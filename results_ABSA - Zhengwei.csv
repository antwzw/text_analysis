Be aware that, not only does ChargePoint charges an additional $5.00 on your credit card on the first purchase (my bill was $22.75 (01:29:00 + 00:01:00 idle time to disconnect ;-(  ) CP made 2 charges; 1 for $10 00 + 1 for $20.00), but depending on the state, they can bill either by the kWh used. Or, by the minute (much more expensive).

Now that I'm aware of CP charging an additional $5.00, I decided to add $2.25, or so (out of $2.75 credit).

After all, why should they be allowed to keep more of my money than they already are?

But, when I pulled up to the first charging station, it took me several minutes to get to the point on the app to, Start Charging. :-(

Once I got it hooked up, and going, all was going OK. Yay!

But, after a few seconds, I noticed a, Not Charging, message. :-(

So, rather than fight that station again, I moved my car to the next one.

And, finally! Got this station working, and added, $2.29 (about 12 miles) to the my EV.

Now, to be honest, these public charging stations are great while traveling. However, depending on the state, regular gas vehicles can be cheaper to fill up.

But, for driving around town, and despite the long time needed to charge on a 110V outlet (12 hours gave me 45 miles. The cost? $0.84! Yes, only eightyfour cents!).

So, for gas vs home electric costs, EVs are a much better deal. Though, still cost prohibitive for many people (starting at around $38,000, and can exceed $250,000).

But, prices are dropping (just like the first Plasma 40"" set was $14,999.99). And, in a few years, EV prices are expected to be under $30K for the lower end models

So, rather than fight that station again, I moved my car to the next one.

And, finally! Got this station working, and added, $2.29 (about 12 miles) to the my EV.

Now, to be honest, these public charging stations are great while traveling. However, depending on the state, regular gas vehicles can be cheaper to fill up.

But, for driving around town, and despite the long time needed to charge on a 110V outlet (12 hours gave me 45 miles. The cost? $0.84! Yes, only eightyfour cents!).

So, for gas vs home electric costs, EVs are a much better deal. Though, still cost prohibitive for many people (starting at around $38,000, and can exceed $250,000).

But, prices are dropping (just like the first Plasma 40"" set was $14,999.99). And, in a few years, EV prices are expected to be under $30K for the lower end models

My EV recommends leaving it plugged in. But, because I live in an open Duplex community, I don't want to risk someone stealing my charger.",0,
