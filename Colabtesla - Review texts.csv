"-Stop at the pilot truck stop before going here.-

Museum is never open in the bathrooms are always locked.

Slept on the walkway and got body slammed into the concrete, trucked my head but....ow.

Whoever runs this Museum apparently can't be bothered to come in, or salt the walkway.

No amenities at this charger, sometimes you can charm the hotel behind you, or walk over the bridge to the Pilot truck stop.

Charger is expensive 40 cents KWh, V2 charger, expect a 25+ dollar charging session."
".32 charge per kwh, driving gasoline is now cheaper. Great location, although Tesla directions stated the location on the wrong side of the road, had to change lanes quickly.
The gas station seems new and is very clean. A lot of food choices to keep you going"
"""The Tesla Supercharger was fast, convenient, and easy to use! Charging my car was a breeze, and the location was great. Highly recommend for Tesla owners.""

""The Tesla Supercharger was fast, convenient, and easy to use! Charging my car was a breeze, and the location was great. Highly recommend for Tesla owners."""
"""You can't drive to Moab, no chance you'll find a charger anywhere near there.""

BOOM!"
(3) 40A chargers
"***NO VALIDATION ***
$3 per hour charge to enter. The sign says validated from local amenities but the cashier at Santos said this changed in 2020. You have to pay in order to charge. There are coffee shops near by that allow you to use the bathroom. ***NO VALIDATION ***"
"***recommended charging stop*** Not only does this spot offer 250kw of charging. It’s also next to a Kum n Go, so by the time you use the restroom, get a snack and drink your charge session is over. I constantly get the full 250kw."
"**Bring your adaptors**There are 6 chargers here at this hotel 2 Tesla brand and 3 universal chargers located in the delta parking lot, make sure the front desk gives you access to the delta lot if not your key will not work if you have access to another lot. There is another charge near the service entrance of the cascade, ask the front desk it is a solo spot near a wall where you do not need an access card. The hotel doesn't enforce EV vehicle parking spots so you might get ICE'd but the cords will reach other spots.  When you charge make sure you stop charging before you pull the plug if not when you come back maintenance will need to open the electric panel and reset the charger for it to work. Lastly be kind to your fellow EV drivers if your done charging move your car to another spot don't just keep it hooked up your whole stay."
"*FYI - parking areas are being resurfaced and these chargers are not accessible August 8 & 9, 2022."
"*Warning No Access*

temporarily closed.
The entire Sheetz facility is undergoing construction and is dug up and completely fenced off."
"#1 rule: don't block the road.

I saw a queue of cars trying to get into the station because someone didn't know the PIN. Everyone else was blocking cross traffic. Please don't do that.

The PIN is on your center console when you click the location details. First hour is free. I like it, it keeps people from staying longer than they need.

The exit is diagonal from the entrance. It's in the back left corner when you enter.

It's a very convenient location with lots of shops within walking distance for food and to kill time. Restrooms available too, but you'll need to talk a couple minutes.

The station has solar panels that shade the car. The location is clean and feels safe."
"#3 Tesla charging station along our trip from Ohio to San Francisco as usual great little location easy to find safe and will it👌🏾👩🏾‍🦱 $7

( HyVee we are parking lot And a great little breakfast spot at 8am)"
"#5 Tesla charger how long are route from Ohio to San Francisco right off the road easy to get to easy and easy out hopefully soon will be able to be gone at least 200 miles distance per charge yay🙏🏾👌🏾👩🏾‍🦱

$13"
#Tesla needs to talk to the Peabody Hotel about blocking access to this charger. The hotel only allows its valets to charge.
~25 stalls. A lot more capacity than the charger on the other side of the freeway. The hotel is very friendly too. No complaints other than I wish it was a little closer to grab and go food. There’s a Starbucks and few other places 5-min walk away.
"🔋8 chargers. Works as expected. This one is based by minute. Which is odd way to bill for charging. 🙂

🚽 You can go to bathroom in Hampton Inn (right next to it).

🍔 McDonalds is right next to the charger as well."
"🔋Great place to stop for a charge. Superchargers work as expected.

🚽 The Sprinx gas station at the charges has THE CLEANEST and nicest bathroom I have seen at a gas station!

🚘 They also have trash can, can for cigarets and windshield washing station at the charger!"
"🔋Nice location with plenty of places to visit. Here are few of them:

Chipotle
Hot Pot BBQ
Calver’s
Tomen Ramen
Tropical Smoothie Cafe
Polio Tropical"
"🤩 Great place to charge!
Close to the highway exit too! 👍"
"$0.34 per kwhr as of 9/22/2022, which is one of cheapest rates on the I-95 corridor currently. Only downside is that Cracker Barrel is only food in walking distance, if only want a snack. But plenty empty chargers so should not have idle chargers if want a full meal"
"$17 for half hour of parking plus the charge rate which I don't even know how much per min is the information I gathered, if so no way."
"$20 *cash* for the “service” of 8kW, when you can get 6kW for $1/hr from ChargePoint public chargers in the town. Less of a service charge and more of a deterrent to would-be drop-in chargers. So slow it’s potentially faster to drive to Duluth and charge. Useful if you are staying in Dahlonega and of course if you are a paying guest, but otherwise use ChargePoint if you want to shop around Dahlonega, or visit the Wineries nearby with chargers rated at 16kW to not waste your time. Got a refund."
"$20 for non-hotel guests, 2 chargers: 1 40A, 1 32 A"
$20 per charge regardless of time or energy used.
$25/day charge to use the EV Charger.
$3 to park. I may use the Supercharger in Mountain Brook the next time I need to charge while passing through Birmingham. 8 stalls. Coffee shop and restruants within walking distance.
"$5 an hour

Was on 22 miles when I got in half an hour later 150 miles $3.48 not to shabby.

Can’t smoke while I wait so 4 stars  😂"
"$6.7 for going from 12% to 50%, without the idle time fee"
"$7 to park for 30min.
$10 to charge 100mi.
Not a horrible spot, typical row on top floor, but not a fan of having to pay anything above the charge rate hence the lost stars."
"0.2 miles from interstate exit. Next to convenience store, grocery store with clean bathroom, fast food. And most of the chargers work, not all. 250kw and maybe one you can use while hauling a trailer, haven't tried it yet to be sure."
"02.05.2022
Winter Off peak price per unit 24cents before 10am Monday thru Sunday
Lots of Tesla Supercharger. This place is behind Benihana, next to Krispy Kreme doughnuts. And next plenty more Tesla supercharger on the other side called ‘The Veranda’ which I can’t write a review.

Sincerely,
KingToFU"
"02.06.2022 (Monday, 8:07am)
Great spot. Nice city. Tesla Supercharger location adjacent to the beach. Near Walgreens, Safeway, This is a shopping centre.

Price per unit 0.24"
02/14/2023 3:15pm - works normally. Even it says temporary closed. Seems electric lines are down due to the weather conditions.
"04/03/2023  Unless you're charging off-hours, expect to wait.  This station is in a very busy, large supermarket parking lot.  I've been here and they've had a society guard keeping order of charging turns.  I generally try to avoid this location if I can."
04/03/2023 I have waited here to charge so try to time your charging if you can. It's nice that there are good options near by.  Walking around the service center to look at the cars on the lot is always fun.
04/03/2023 I've never had to wait to charge here.   There are good food options near by.
04/03/2023 You have to go down into the underground parking lot to find the chargers.  Never had to wait to charge here.
"07.30.2022 (Saturday) 10:47am
Hello Supercharger | Martinez CA
16 stalls (250 kW max) |
charging fee $0.29 any time. WOW!
Idle fees (up to) $1.00/min

02.04.2022 (Friday)
Brand new. Great shopping area.
Came here between 8am - 9am, unit per charge 0.38 Cents but weird because other city I have visited have the same price point during offpeak or peak."
"08/08/22 Update - 250kw. Nice and fast. Battery down to 60 charging at 700.  Clean restroom in Smithfield Chicken & BBQ. 7 stalls. 4 occupied.

12/16/22 - Update.  Looks like things are working great again. Thanks for the electrons and best fried chicken ever. Love you SCNB. Tell Maggie I said hello.

Charged here previously and was pretty fast around 400. Today 1st charger was at 212 the 2nd one would not charge. Now parked at a 3rd that's only doing 192. What's up with this station? :/"
"1 and only charging point for tesla in Myrtle Beach. 150kw only. Take your time to charge your tesla a little more than what you need . The fastest one with 250kw is only available  120 miles away from this place, that's florence sc. Tesla should  upgrade this to 250kw with the latest generation."
"1 charger not working and people waiting, by the time you figure out it’s a dud, you have to get at the ends of line.  Busy/crowded shopping mall, not my cup of tea."
"1 of the 2 Chargers at TownePlace Suites in Dothan is broken and does not work, as of July 2022. Management has no ETA on a fix and has supposedly been down for quite some time. The front one is up, but usually occupied. Tesla charger in the back of the hotel is broken."
1 Tesla charger and 1 Level 2 (48A)
1 Tesla plug + 1 third party plug. Short walk to downtown Brevard. Free :)
"1 working Tesla charger (which only gives 8-10 miles/hour). 1 sorta working J1772 charger as well offering ~25mph (but it would stop charging for some odd reason after an hour or two, happened twice). I would try to manually reduce the amp draw in Tesla charger settings to about 20-25amps??). Reviewed 3/14/2021"
"1. Plug in
2. Get major powah
3. Grab some WaWa goodness
4. Winner winner"
"1) Happy this supercharger was there!

2) Tesla display says it's rated for 120kw but I was the only car there and was only getting 56kw, even with 20+ minutes of battery preconditioning."
"10 chargers, Dunkin’ Donuts on the lot, bojangles next door, baskin robins, McDonald’s and subway across the street. Only one other Tesla here on a regular Tuesday afternoon"
10 kw 40 amps 240 volt. 2 tesla charger and 1 j1772
10 kw power flow
10 level 2 Tesla chargers that charge at 32A/205V. They were free when I was there.
10 out of 10. Would charge again. 😉
10 places to hook up to.  Looks like it stays pretty busy
10 plus Tesla Superchargers directly off 35. Chargers are conveniently located near several fast food restaurants which makes ease to grab a quick bite to eat and to use the bathroom super easy.
10 stalls 150kW. 24/7. Thank you Tesla and heb. Excellent spot
10 stalls and no one there😁  300 mile per hour charge rate on 2B.  I love Tesla!
10 stalls and one is a front in. They were resurfacing the pool parking lot 6/6/2018 so it should be nice for a while. Don't try to go to the bathroom in the gas station they don't have one. Starbucks across the parking lot or meijer. Is your best bet. You Could go to Wallgreens cross the highway before you stop to charge as well.
"10/29/22 There is a Tesla charging station here! It's right next to the front door of La quinta. There's only one.
I don't know if it's working, but I guess it is. There was no indication of any problem."
100 KW so super slow. If you do stop. Utica Bread is awesome for breakfast.
"100 yd from McDonald's. You can shop at Meijer while you wait or even walk across the street to Menards if you really like to. there's an AutoZone right here also, not really useful for EV owners though. Unless you need washer fluid. 🤷‍♂️"
"100kW max, wish they would upgrade to 250 as these get pretty busy. Plenty of shopping and food options"
10am on a Monday and there was only one other charger being used. Very conveniently located at a truck stop with a full restaurant and facilities. Bathrooms were clean and the people were friendly.
10kw and 7kw free of charge
10KW x 3 Tesla destination chargers courtesy of Hilton Garden Inn. Easy access to and from freeway.
"11 Superchargers at the Circle K! They have a squee-gee to clean your windshield and windows as well as a Purell hand pump! Super clean, easy to find, and no issues with charging!"
"11 superchargers with plenty of parking around the Wawa for ICE vehicles not to block the superchargers. Typical Wawa inside, super clean and plenty to snack or even eat more of a meal.
Plenty of other places to eat at with in 5 minutes walking if you want. Publix supermarket is across the street and they have Great! sub sandwiches."
11 X 250kW stalls and they’re all open mid day. Quick n easy on the way south.
"1100mi/hr charging.   Briefly.
Still,  really high power"
116kW 4 supercharger stations as others have posted prior so l can see how other people would have to wait. I suppose I got lucky because I had no wait when I went.
12 - 250 kWh chargers. Wegmans and plenty of stores nearby. Follow loop directions going around REI and you'll be able to locate the chargers across PNC bank & Ulta.
"12 - v3 250kWh super chargers, conveniently located just seconds off I-95. This location has an Oasis 24 hour convenience store with bathrooms snacks coffee etc. a Dunkin’ Donuts and a traditional gas station if you need to clean your windscreen or get rid of trash. There are also two ChargePoint fast chargers here with CCS and Chademo connectors. I still wish they had a windshield cleaning station and a trashcan at the superchargers. Overall great location."
"12 150 and 12 250kW chargers! No wait! Charging so fast, I barely had time to pee."
12 250kW chargers. Most back to back. Short walk to recharge and discharge as needed. Plenty of other offerings a stone's throw away.
"12 chargers, 2 cars charging at 7 am on Sunday. Dunkin is nearby."
12 charging stations at this Suoercharger location right off the I-5 highway and next to a Panera. A row of 9 with 1 and 2 along the sides. No waiting at 11:30 am on a Saturday.
12 new V3 Superchargers. Conveniently located in a Shaws market center.
"12 ports to charge,  one pull up one , definitely empty in the morning  ;)"
12 stalls with shopping nearby
"12 stalls, 250kW V3, next to a Wendy's. Pull-in style. Easy access coming in and out. Several food options and a Circle K nearby."
12 stalls.
12 stations available. Low traffic area. Takes about 40 minutes to be fully charged for a long range model Y @ 530 miles/hr rate.
12 Tesla Supercharger stalls located at the MidCity development in Huntsville. It’s centrally located and walkable to restaurants and bathrooms. Easily accessible from University Drive and Research Park Blvd.
"12 Tesla superchargers and super clean bathrooms. It reminds me of Buc-ee’s in Texas but with a drive-through Burger King! Great place to stop if you need gas, food, restrooms, or an electric charge for your Tesla."
12 units. Right off the highway and in a shopping plaza. Red Robin within walking distance and across from Dick’s sporting goods.
12 Wonderful Superchanging station's so close to the mall for restrooms! Again Restrooms* also a nice walking path to stretch out your legs. Great automatic night lighting
120kw !!! Around 326 miles per hour. There was one stall that wasn’t working. The 4th one starting from the left side.
"13 miles from the Parkway and you can even zipline
while your charging...."
"14 beautiful Tesla stalls @150kW. Great charging location with Woods Coffee, Subway, Jack in the Box and many more places to eat and shop!

Opened: October, 11th, 2019!"
"14 chargers! Perhaps the best location between Dallas and Memphis. Plenty of chargers, small town, Denny's connected to large gas station with huge, clean bathrooms. This is the stop to plan for when traveling."
142kw. Clean but only charging. There are however several hotels and provisions nearby.
147kw but some chargers are lower. If your low on charge and your not getting 140kw or above move.
"15 250kW chargers. One is a pull through suitable for a Tesla pulling a trailer.
Good bathrooms at Dave and Busters."
150 kilowatt charger that is usually not very busy. Normally cost 40 cents per kilowatt hour.
150 kW 1ab 2ab 3ab 4ab very convenient except much traffic entering right in front of chargers. Also 4ab chargers didn’t work for me and another Tesla.
150 kw charger in the wall drug parking lot on the south side of town. Not much nearby after hours. Swing by one of the 24 hr gas stations if you need to use the restroom or get some snacks!
150 kW charger in the Wawa parking lot. Starbucks within walking distance.
150 kW stated.  74kW was the max I could get.
150 KWH charge station with ample spots. Good amenities of DD and convenience store. 2 DC fast chargers are available at the end from NC energy. Right off of 95 makes this an easy stop. No tow ready spots though. Trash cans and window cleaners provided to make it better.
"150 kWh charges at the mall parking lot. No trash cans onsite, you'll need to wait to the mall if you need to discard trash."
"150kw and easy walk to a Wawa and other restaurants.  One of the chargers had a broken ""pin"" in the charger handle and would not plug into my charge port."
150kw chargers but the hotel let's you use the nice and clean restrooms and will sell you a drink while you wait.
150kw so no speed records. At a Sheetz so there is a bathroom but it is a food desert. Nothing available here should be eaten for best health. grab a coffee at Dunkin just down the road on the way back to the I-81
150kw supercharger with a Mountain View
"150kw superchargers. This place has Starlink terminal!!
When I visited this morning, it was empty but the chargers were working."
"150kW v2.  Top up going to or coming back from Flagstaff, or Sedona.   We always end up buying something at the gas station.  We've been here both day time and many times late at night with no issues."
"16 charge spots and rarely full.  The Brunswick square mall is okay as far as malls go but you do have an easy walk to the Barnes and noble that also has a cafe.  The mall has a Red Robin burger place, Bar Louie with outdoor dining, Panera Bread and a few smaller places inside the mall.  There is also an AMC theater here as well.   There are 4 Volta chargers here with no specific time limits but since those are in prime parking spots those are usually filled with non EVs.  These are all Level 3 chargers and since you rarely have half the stations filled, you usually never receive the penalty for not getting your car out once you’re done charging.

The asphalt is a little run down compared to other Tesla chargers in a 20 mile radius"
"16 charger available .
Only 2car’s here.
No restroom available.
Movie theater, small stores ..
Every store put on sign”No public restroom “ Really?
What kind of place are here?"
16 chargers behind the McDonalds. 3 to 4 restaurants nearby. They should have a sign coming off the interstate. But fast charging.
"16 chargers, 250 kw, trash cans, picnic table, dog friendly (bags / va-poo-rise), Sinclair gas station, clean bathrooms, snacks"
"16 charging stalls, right off I-75, lots of fast food options within a short walk"
"16 stalls at 250kW max at $0.42/kW

I got charging speeds up to 110kW today 3/1/23"
16 stalls. 250 kW max. Near Chuy’s restaurant in Briargate.
"16 superchargers and 16 destination chargers, great location close to mall"
16 Superchargers... mostly unoccupied at 5pm today.
"16 Tesla superchargers and 4 other ev chargers located in the same parking lot as target, ronin, scissors & scotch, yoga six, blue sky, Logan house coffee, crisp & green, mod pizza, I scream gelato, Torchys and chase bank!"
16 v3s right off highway. Nice travel center with a dennys. All supercharger spots should be at places like this
164 kW on Sunday afternoon with one other EV (and one ICE block).
"19 stalls! One of the larger supercharger stops. It’s also located right outside Palisades mall so plenty of things to do.

Includes a easily accessible Starbucks where you can order with the mobile app."
"1A charges pretty slowly, but we switched to 3A and it is much faster. Flying J is pretty good. Nice bathrooms, lots of food options either in a bag or warm. Pizza, chicken fingers/strips, and...Cinnabon (but I didn’t get one)."
"1abc 2abc chargers. busy stop, ICE van was parked in a Tesla spot but we were the only ones charging"
"1abcd 2abcd got 240kW rate. Good convenience store at Airport Rd and across the street there are IHOP, Chipotle, and other restaurants."
1abcd and 2abcd. Convenient Hannafords has restrooms and food.
"1B and 1C working great 9-17 and 9-18 2022
They have added a plastic cover on the south side to prevent people from parking on the south side of the chargers even though it really wouldn't take much difference as there is only about an 8 inch difference from which side of the concrete the supercharger is on. So it's more just a deterrent to get people to the right side! (North)"
1B not working. On backside of mall so kinda creepy at night. Be aware.
1st floor winds
"1St Review !
I just love the 250kW Stations, they’re liquid cooled and can charge at 1,000+ mph
In this place you can have Casa Garcia’s, 5-Guys Burger, Chick Fil-A, iHop etc

Viva México cbrns Ajuaaaa"
2 chargers at the Abby Inn Suites. 1 charger is a Tesla destination charger. The other charger is J1772. The sign says charging is only for hotel guests and others will get towed :(
"2 chargers right next to Motel 6.  Chargers worked good, but if you are looking for a restful overnight stay, this motel is NOT ideal....too much overnight train noise and hallway noise."
2 chargers up front
"2 chargers weren’t working, good stop, quick charge"
2 chargers. 4 stars for being there. Not 5 because of slow charging speed. Hard to find. Located right by Tiger Blvd entrance of currently closed Best Western. Between hotel street entrance and back of CVS. See picture.
2 charging spots.  Clean and comfortable cabins and a nice cafe with strong coffee and good wifi. Perfect stop on way into or out of Bryce Canyon or Zion
"2 destination chargers in the parking lot of the Bryce Canyon inn. Coffee shop right in front, and 3 restaurants within 200 ft."
2 free anytime Tesla HPWC and a Clipper Creek charger as well
"2 of 3 chargers work, most days they are free but you will find the occasional ICE vehicles parked there."
"2 of 3 spots filled by gas cars. The one spot left for me did charge my M3D at 39mph, so pretty pleased with that."
2 of the 4 spots were ICED but it was nice that the chargers were near the front door. Definitely a good stop on the way from the cities to Marshall!
"2 of the 6 chargers (2a & 2b)were not working on June 18th and June 20th. 2 of the chargers had physical damage, but we're working fine.   Located next to McDonalds and Tourist information office.  Nice grass strip for dogs."
2 out of 3 chargers works for me and most EV owners here moves their cars once it done helps a lot too. Thanks all of those who are doing their part and act responsively and allows everyone to use the charger and enjoy their vacations in Destin.
"2 stalls not working on August 16, 2022"
2 Tesla chargers and 1 clipper creek.
"2 Tesla chargers at level 2 and 2 common at  level 1. Haven’t tried the common 1. The Tesla charger is 16 kWh gives me around. 28 mile/ hr.
The garage charge $1/hr. First 30 min free"
"2 Tesla chargers, in the parking lot on the south side of Papa Joe's restaurant, spots marked “electric cars only”.  One Tesla connector, onestandard J1772 connector."
"2 Tesla Destination Chargers, 240V 48A, Free to use for an EV."
2 tesla destination chargers. Facility is cheap for the general area as it was listed as $2 total for 5pm-5am and $1 per hr otherwise. Not a bad option relative to valet parking for hotels in area and obviously self funds parking fee relative to a supercharger (note: i was getting 8kwh on the tesla charger)
2 Tesla HPWC's -> 40A  209V 8kW and one J-1772
"2 Tesla Wall Connectors and a single Clipper Creek J1772 charger are set up here in Chetola Resort. The Tesla wall connector I used gave me the full 48A supported on single phase by that charger model, for 12kW observed charging; which is decently fast; a full charge in a few hours on all but the largest EVs. The resort is mostly timeshare apartments but they also do events here, and they welcome public entry at the gate. If you’re not staying here overnight, the charger is well situated for the restaurant, and there’s also other resort activities like a spa with a pool, hot tub, sauna, and fixed exercise machines, and a children’s play area. Lake Chetola is home to swans and stocked with fish for catching, canoes for hire - and a Bocce Ball court. There are also several multi-mile hikes starting at the resort."
2 Tesla Wall connectors. Currently charging my AWD Model 3 at 38 mph.
2 Teslas. 1 Non-Tesla
2/8 stalls offline on this day. 🫤
20 stations at 250kw. What's more to say
"20 Superchargers, available 24/7, up to 150kW

The first two I tried to charge with were broken. One would not latch properly to start the charge and the other had a bent prong.

This charging station is close to shopping and fast food."
"2019 Model 3 charging at 250+ kW (1021 m/hr) and it’s also in easy walking range to many restaurants.

It’s in the parking lot of a Royal Farms also so there’s those snacks and restrooms if you just want something quick."
"2022: upgrading rating based on two factors
1) ll bean and thus bathrooms in ll bean are open 24  hours a day
2) the back entrance of ll bean is a lot closer to the charging station, previously we used the front entrance which was quite a bit further
2019:
I rate superchargers based not only on charging but location of bathrooms and snacks.  This charging station is located 5 or 6 minute walk to ll bean where the bathrooms are located on the second floor. There restaurants but no quick snacks. We were charge a small fee for taking too long, as the walk and doing our business took more time than allowed. Overall not the best option for charging as you lose at least 10 minutes for just the walk, we took 7 minutes inside. Tesla allowed 15. In addition Verizon had no internet connectivity there so a 5 minute warning did not arrive until after the fact."
"225 mi/hr Virginia Beach, VA, USA 🇺🇸"
24 charging stations!  Always a spot available!
"24 stalls, 6 groups of 4, each group is 250k.  it's behind a bucees, with each access."
"24-hour gas station - good spot to sto.  Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Subway and Chester's Chicken at the gas station. charger even had a squeegee for the windows (although it was not refilled) I appreciated that"
24/7 bathroom.. between the restaurants and hotel. No trash cans
240 Volts at 12 Amps?  It was not worth the drive or parking fee to use it...
240v only.  Not supercharger.
"245kW here. Nice food and shopping options walking distance nearby. No great views like Twin Falls, unfortunately."
"25 superchargers, usually free or frees up very frequently. It’s downstairs in the garages, protected from rain. The stations are all working and in good condition."
250 and 150 lots of them. Ground level in garage. Open air flow. Whole Foods about 138 steps.  Hide from the sun or the rain.  Lots of shops at the Palladio.
"250 kilowatt chargers were great, however be ready to wait a little bit due to the amount of traffic. I wish there were more stalls that's my only gripe because of the amount of teslas who were waiting their turn but overall 4 out of 5 stars"
250 kw  8 stalls. Excellent but let limited amenities. No wifi.
250 kw 16 stalls designed really well for the layout plenty of space to turn and back in.  There’s a few restaurants and shops nearby.
"250 kW charger saves time! If you are Supercharging during business hours, go into the front of the showroom and use the lounge, restroom and get coffee or snacks! Friendly Tesla staff."
250 kW charging is cool!
"250 kw charging is the only thing positive about this charger.

Chargers are tucked way, WAY, out of the way on the side of Meijer.  Walking to the store to get snacks or use a restroom will require a substantial walk. Disable people don't have access to any facilities."
"250 kW charging, and Cabela’s nearby has restrooms and lots to browse even if you’re not into hunting or fishing"
"250 kW fast charging !  Grab groceries, personal care and household goods at Woodman’s 24 hour store that only takes debit cards, Discover cards or cash for payment.  Bathrooms are always open. Woodman’s always has a great selection of Wisconsin cheeses, brats, Kringle & more!  It’s an interesting store to browse during off hours.  Beware…it can get very busy during peak hours.  An easy walk to White Castle, Dunkin’ Donuts (in the Shell gas station) or Poke & Teriyaki."
250 kW makes quick work of charging! Not too far from the highway!
"250 kw per hour as indicated in google maps no, it's good if there is 109kw per hour(("
"250 kW supercharger at Harris Teeter (Kroger) grocery store. Also an easy walk across the parking lot to eat at Mellow Mushroom, Nectar and a few other places."
"250 kW, 8 stalls, lodging, supermarket, restaurants nearby. A+ Headed towards Yellowstone after entering the US from Waterton National Park (Canadian side of Glacier National Park) and taking the scenic route. Started at 378 miles and had 6 left. It told me to detour to Great Falls but nah I like living on the edge of range anxiety. 🤣 Plus it shaved off about 90 minutes if I had to detour.

I also have a roof tent so my range was reduced by about 15%. If you want to calculate a detailed range, check your Trip menu and calculate your actual efficiency in Watt-hours vs displayed range after driving 100 miles. Pretty low hills coming down too. Mine was 378 miles displayed starting with an actual range around 270 miles. So I needed ~1/3 more displayed range than the actual miles to destination."
250 kw!
"250 KW! Getting over 1000 mph charge rate on my Model 3. Nice! Not much else to do here though, so good thing it won't take long."
"250k charging good food options, as previous reviewer said navigation defaults you to slower location of chargers."
250K works great. Behind the store.
250kw and she's pushing close to it. Great location at a Wawa. Will definitely put this on the top supercharger stops.
250kw but only Walmart to go to. Bojangles if you want a little walk. Never crowded.
"250kW but still speed at 500kms/ hr , plaza is not that big and 800m from hwy exit ."
"250kW charger next to the Hampton Inn.  Restroom is located inside Hampton Inn, make a right side immediately past the entrance, go through the reception area and you will find it near the two water fountains."
250kw charger right off the highway. Perfect stop on the way out of Orlando for a quick charge and snack.
"250kw charger, sheetz parking lot so option for snacks and restrooms. Arby’s is walkable, Wendy’s and McDonald’s are just down the street. CVS in walking distance, as well"
"250kW chargers at a huge 2-3 story mall - not too far away from rte 90 so it’s preferable to the other Syracuse Supercharger by rte 90. Located by At Home and Lord & Taylor (now closed).  Between those two, you can enter the mall.
For restrooms, walk past the escalators and H&M, then by the giant slide/spiral staircase take a left."
250kW chargers in a great location next to a Wawa and many other options. Rates are low as well.
250kW charging is great ... BUT is in the parking lot of a plaza that CLOSES REALLY EARLY EVERYDAY ... BEWARE!!  So no restrooms or food after the plaza closes!!
"250kw max charger works well, and it’s in the Big Hat 6 parking lot right up close to the entrance so no frozen sprints across a football field-length lot to get to a bathroom! Plus this Big 6 gas station has a pretty good convenience store with a fun western theme, coffee stand, and more food options than a typical convenient store."
250kw no waiting. Near REI.
250kw so it's very fast. Clean location. It's in an Asian shopping center so there are some restaurants and stores nearby.
"250kw so very fast, it's also in an isolated part of the parking lot so it won't get taken up by other vehicles. Good places to eat nearby too"
"250kW stalls and easy access to food and restrooms 24/7. Trashcans next to chargers with windshield cleaner water

Have never seen another Tesla changing at the same time. Super empty close to interstate exit, awesome opportunity for stop and charge."
"250kW station
There's a mall 5 mins walking distance away"
250KW station in theory but 2 cars here and I’m down to 66KW. But very convenient if you are on NJ15 S
250kw super chargers here!  Fast charge and in the parking lot of a gas station. It’s rare to find the 250kw on I-55. I was the only vehicle here at around 2pm on a Thursday.
"250KW supercharger, currently all working and Meijer keeps the spots clean during snow. I got 1100mi/hr charge rate!"
250kw supercharger! Convenient and fast! 7 eleven stop with washrooms.
250kW Supercharger. Safe area. nugget ice.  Clean bathroom. Friendly staff.
"250kW V3 and not busy.

At Sheetz with plenty of food options within walking distance."
250kw V3!
"250kW, ample parking space in the middle of a shopping mall parking lot so it's quite safe. The coffee from jolts is nice and they have many flavors to try from."
250kW. 3 restaurants right beside it.  Cash Wise grocery store a simple walk across the parking lot. There is a windshield wash station provided by the local Tesla owners on site.  Be prepared for a lot of looks and possibly some questions!
250kw. Right by Target that you can get coffee.
250kw. Very nice.
"250kw.... Great stop.
30ft walk to lots of food and bathrooms.
2min of northbound. 30sec off southbound.
No trailer stall.

Not sure ppl understand state of charge. Tesla charges slowwer after 50% percent and VERY slow above 70%..."
250W chargers and we saw max 250 which is nice.  Charged 18-80 in about 20 mins plus Sheets is a good place to grab a sandwich.  Saw other reviews about slow charge but starting at 18% we saw full stated power so maybe they fixed something
250W supercharger!
260kw with 90 miles in the tank. In the Circle K where you can even get a car wash. Easy off easy in the Hiway.
28 stalls (250kW) there is a Starbucks across the way and a Subway on the opposite side.
"28 watts charge, not the fastest but free.. awesome place, and scenery!!"
"2A and 2B are not working. Had to move charging stations 2x, and only charges to 80% due to high usage. Otherwise, as expected."
"2A at 95kW 20% soc.  In back of a Phillips 66 gas station.  No real great food options but previous exit has lots of food including Jimmy Johns, McDonalds, Arby’s, DQ, KFC and Taco Johns."
"2A charging port is not working. It kept saying that the charger is not secure, and I got a Solid T. It happened to several cars while I was there. I informed the other users. They may try again to see if it was a user error, but I was right. Not working properly. I also send a message to Tesla service via the Tesla App."
2A was only charging at 44 kW.  I moved to 1B and it’s pulling 146 kW.
2B and 3A is down. Push button won't open charge port
3 basic level 2 chargers and 4 super chargers. It’s awesome. Supercharging was 47c per kWh on 7/1/22. Makes going from anchorage to homer and back doable.
3 chargers out of order.   Target in walking distance for bathroom etc.  Not really anything else in walking distance.  Not one of the best stops but I got charged up and that’s what counts the most!
"3 chargers, bar/restaurant onsite to visit if charging.  Nice location for wedding or individual stay. 30-40mph charge speed"
3 chargers. 2 with tesla heads. Giving me 35m/hr
"3 charging stalls total. 2 Charge Point J1772 connections. 1 Tesla (Destination Charger, slow) connection. I got 28 miles per hour charging using the Tesla connection. The Tesla charger is free but the Charge Point connection costs $1.50 for each of the first 3 hours, then $3.00 per hour after the first 3 hours."
"3 good food choices: Wendy’s, Elevation Burger and my favorite: Auntie Anne’s pretzels!

Stall 1A is my favorite here as I regularly get 110kW versus some others giving around 90 when I’m the only Tesla on the pair."
3 of 6 chargers are down.  This location is important for east west and south travel. Needs to be fixed ASAP and it needs more chargers either here or somewhere nearby.
3 of 8 chargers blocked by ICE cars. Busy parking lot. Glad to have this charger available but would prefer a more EV friendly location.
3 out of the 6 stalls are not working.
3 parking spots (1 handicap) conveniently located by the entrance on the 1st floor.
"3 stars only because the map shows 0 stalls available even though they were all open. Something is wrong with the open stall count. I always charge in Kinston, this is the best place to charge on Hwy 70 between Raleigh and Atlantic Beach. On my way to Morehead I saw that it said 0 open on the car’s map. So I stopped out of the way in Goldsboro. Drove past the Kinston charging station later and there were 7/8 open. Going back home 2 days later, map still shows 0 open. I didn’t need to charge but stopped to check it out. All of them were open, I plugged in and it worked. Correct stall count makes a difference with only a few places to charge on the route! Otherwise great stop. Just needs this fixed, but not sure how to let someone know it’s messed up."
3 tesla chargers and 1 universal charger available for free 24/7. Not 'super' but drawing 26 mi/hour midday.
3 tesla chargers and 2 juice box chargers. First come first serve for autocamp guests. Really helps when we visit Yosemite and we stay at autocamp.
"3 Tesla Destination Chargers at this location, 240V, 48A charge. Got up to 46miles/hr of charge. Charged my model 3 for free, super close to restaurants on Richmond Rd."
3 Tesla destination chargers located inside the guest garage parking of The Modern Honolulu hotel.
"3/12/2023

As with most Tesla chargers, it's located near another business but doesn't have it's own bathrooms or anything so we ended up getting blizzard at DQ to use the facilities which isn't a huge sacrifice but can't wait until we get EV rest centers with proper facilities."
3/6 of the chargers actually work. Both chargers on the end work. Could not figure out how to report it through the app.
"300+ mile per hour charging. Never busy. Great location close to grocery stores, Target restaurants, and strip mall."
"31/miles hr Tesla charger, grab a bite while you charge, would highly recommend the pub!"
"31mi/hr charging rate, but they let me charge even tho not a guest..."
35 miles per hour destination charger 🙌🙌
36 miles/hr which was awesome when the destination charger in Navarre was out of order. You do not have to be a guest at Portofino to use this; one is outside of their gates.
361 mi/hr in this location 8 Tesla superchargers
"36amps, 208v.  Nice place to hang while getting a boost!"
39mi/hr  @ 40A 250V
"3A was charging at half speed until I moved to a different stall. If you're not getting 100+ kW and the only car there and not near 80% try it. Also the guy complaining being limited to 80%, it does that if it's busy but you can still adjust it to 100%. They just want to get the line moving but you can override it."
3b 245kw max. I love the 250 chargers
"3D stall was fine on 6/26/22. 3A was occupied, but 3B and 3C were vacant."
"3rd charger from the end does not work has a bent pin, will not insert in port. Cmon Elon fix this!  Not that close to food."
3x 16 kW installed recently
3x 8kw chargers. They should put up EV only parking signs as multiple ICE cars were parked in them. Not many other charging options around this area.
4 chargers locsted besude front e trsnce--perfect locatio !
"4 of 8 Chargers were occupied (blocked) by non-Tesla vehicles. The manager of the Loves gas station claimed that there was nothing that she could do about it because her staff needed those parking places. When you arrive to charge, you may find that “your” slot is taken up by a Loves’ employee’s or customer’s non-Tesla vehicle."
4 pull in spots. Some of the slowest charging I have had at a Supercharger. Appears to be the only option in Cheyenne. If driving through on I-80 try to resist the temptation of the 80 MPH speed limit and baby your way to Laramie (West) or Sidney (East).
"4 spots. Charges at 48amps. About 39mph.
If two cars are here, it charges at 32mph. It’s free and you don’t need to be staying at the hotel to use it."
4 stars instead of 5 because 1B was charging at 1/3 the capable charge rate. Plugged into 2A and it worked much better! I am the only one here.
"4 stills not working. Scary area. Too far from I26.
There still is no easy way to travel from Charleston to Asheville.
This location makes no sense. If traveling on I-95 use  Santee."
4 super chargers weird parking.  and many many chargers at the hotel.  Speed was slow but best on the island.
4 Tesla and 2 J1772 stations.  One of the J1772 stations is inoperative and has been for some time.
"4 Tesla and one ChargePoint chargers. On the ground floor, back wall of this parking garage. Didn't have any issues with non-EVs parking in the spots, even when the garage was busy."
"4 Tesla chargers, plus 2 J-1772 chargers.  Great location at the Anchor Beach Inn."
4 Tesla Destination chargers here front and center and free at the Comfort Inn & Suites!
"4 Tesla Destination EV chargers in working order on East side of TownePlace Suites by Marriott Rochester.

These work with non-Tesla EVs too."
"4.2/5

Location is a bit hidden.
It’s behind the gas station and convenience store, etc.

The layout is good to accommodate charge locations. Just because it is busy the speed of charge dropped after 70% as always.

Otherwise good location. Nice and easy access off the highway"
"4.5/5

Really busy when I got here. Due to that my charge limit has been adjusted.
Pretty good location off the highway. Washroom are available in the TA travel center and some snacks"
"4/28/2022
I've used this Cha going Stations 3-4X now. And I've got to say:

-If you are around the Elk Grove area, and you require a Supercharger Station ⛽ this one's got you covered, for now!

-With double rows and it being so close to the highway system and main roads, you will more than likely not have to travel too far for a quick charge!

-Within breathing distance and a stones throw to shopping, restaurants and boutique shops...this locations got your back!

Original post
I'll gather some picks next charge-up, however there is a two-sided (double row)***** > Ports Available ***** (that seem to be available) > of the time [my experience so far eg @different days and times ]."
"4/5

8 stalls and busy location.

There is holiday inn right behind and a burger 🍔 place in the same lot.
Very small detour from the highway. There is also a coin Carwash near by.

Definitely recommend."
"4/5

Good charge location!
Sheetz Gas ⛽️. Found a couple of truckers parking in the charge station spaces just to prove a point that they have smaller D**ks.

Other than that pretty decent location to charge your Tesla. Not too far from the highway."
"4/5

Good location for chargers. All the Tesla by passers should choose this place for overnight stay for comfort. Not sure how good the hotel is.

Speeds are usual"
4/8 stations working only. Not common. They need to add another station between Osoyoos and Creston.
"4/8/2023: Not busy around 5PM, walked to the nike clearance store while waiting for the charge. Bathrooms at the McDonalds were clean."
"4/9/2023: Happy to see this place is still in tact. Still convenient and was not busy during my visit.

10/16/2022: Convenient Supercharger, I always pass by here to charge my Tesla when I make my trip to Seattle. It's close to Denny's, McDonald's, Country Cousin, Safeway (Starbucks inside), Chevron, Papa Murphy's Take 'N' Bake Pizza, and Motel 6 Centralia. Literally find everything and anything you might be looking for while on a long road trip. There are trash bins around to throw out any trash you might have which is nice."
40 amps at 239v!  Thanks Sugar Beach / Grand Beach!
43kw charge. Took forever to charge. Nothing to do around the charger.  Restaurant at the hotel is closed. Why can we not get chargers in areas that have convenience items or some sort of shopping within walking distance?
44 miles an hour. Free parking
47 cents/ kw. At the base of the Sierra’s. Lots of stalls. Close to downtown. 15 mins of charge and we are good with a 90% charge. Love it. This was $15 to give me half a tank for you gasoline drivers. Cheap.
47kw isnt good. Why are these so slow?
"48 amps - 2 great chargers, and walking distance to several restaurants. A little hard to find, but just go to 21 Main restaurant (It feels a little strange driving past guard gate, but no issue), and chargers are on the left side of that restaurant towards the back."
"48kwh average, 250kwh, 16 chargers, we were the only ones there."
4th year in a row that half the chargers don't work and the rest are incredibly slow.
5 EV & Tesla chargers on the 4th floor. Awesome place to charge while exploring Main St.
5 ev chargers and none worked - 2 partially worked but we're very slow.  Agitated to be an electronic issue with all chargers.
5 of the 8 charging stations were occupied by gas combustion engine cars. They weren’t parked there while folks who couldn’t find other parking ran in to Sheetz to make purchases or use the rest rooms. They were were there the entire time we charged. Sheets management said they couldn’t do anything.
5 star is the rating id like to give. However its always a few that dont work.......Not looking for trouble...However..Elon: Tighten up young man....   :)
"5 star since we were staying at the Comfort Inn. 4 Tesla destination chargers for hotel guests only (they log users to insure no one is hauled away who is not staying at the hotel).
Free charging at about 23 miles charging capacity per hour, so by the next morning, you're good to go. Clean, lighted parking lot. I booked here because Tesla acknowledged them as a destination charge sight. Glad I did."
"5 stars for the supercharger, 1 star for the locals that love to block access with their ICE vehicles. Be prepared for 1-3 stalls taken up by normal cars at all times. Luckily there aren't too many Tesla's in the area yet, so I've always been able to charge."
"5 stars to Tesla for new SC around Collin county, but this is not a good location for a SC in this parking lot. The parking lot is a way too small, so during normal times the parking spaces are taken over by patrons of the strip mall. As I sit here, half the spaces are taken by non-charging cars. Good on Tesla for expanding, just maybe the SC should have been on the side or rear lot where the spaces would not be taken over so readily."
"5/5

250kw
7- stations available

There is gas station and non Tesla charges.
Convenience store
Coffee
Food
And McDonald’s is right opposite to the charge location."
500mi/hr with 6 cars charging. Easy to find food drink shopping within walking distance. Easy on and off the highway.
"5pm on a friday. All V2 chargers and all seemed to be working. Charge rate of 127kwh. 7 stalls open when I got there (someone else showed up when I got there and left before I did)  Not bad, pretty quick stop. People inside were friendly. But trash cans overflowing near the flying J entrance. Restrooms were clean.  Would be nice to have a v3 supercharger in the area but the 15 minute stop went by real quick."
6 10kw Tesla chargers. One of the only places in town with charging. All the more important given the lack of a Columbus super charger.
6 Chargers. This is 150 kW charger not 120 as shown on google maps.  I’m charging at 143 kW right now and 536 mi/hr This is a New Sheetz gas station. 👍🏻👍🏻
"6 nice chargers in COOP gas station.  Coffee, snacks and clean washroom.  Watch out for ICE'd parking spots as those Internal Combustion Engines don't know the rules and park in Tesla spots."
"6 of 8 stalls free at 11:45 on a Friday, charged from 30% to 80% in 20 minutes. In Sheetz parking lot, so convenient for snacks, etc."
"6 Ports fast (but not fastest) Superchargers.  Way off HWY. Many many stores around open during day.
Steak'n Shake across street that is open 24/7 that has restrooms​ AND free WiFi with hot food :-) ."
6 station total. You can drive a Tesla from Ontario to Winnipeg without a problem.
6 Tesla Supercharger stalls located in Long Term Parking #2 lot at the airport. This is a paid gated lot however there was no charge on exit after 45 minutes of charging. It’s close enough to walk inside for restrooms near the airport ticketing counters.
"6 Tesla superchargers and 4 non-Tesla chargers.  I was staying at the hotel and charging overnight was great!  Pulled in with 10% and woke up to a charged car.  Not fast enough to use as a pit stop, but that’s not the point of these chargers."
"6 v2 Charge Points 140 amps max on my P100DModel-X Not quite as nice as the Northbound wayside with historic water wheele inside and almost all the amenities of the other side. They have the diner, sandwich shop, souvenirs, Missing is the Newhampshire Craftsman shop with hand made glass. They do have a drive up window in the back of the diner though."
"6/4/22
Stall 4A wasn't working because one of the prongs on the charging head was bent. 4B charged without any issues. Ruby Tuesday had no problems with us using the restrooms despite not buying anything.

On our return trip Ruby Tuesday wasn't open yet so we used the restrooms at the Exxon just behind the supercharger which were clean."
"6/8 spots were ICEd when we showed up. Currently the whole adjacent gas station lot is under construction so seemingly the workers were all parked in the charging spots. Initially we were unable to even access the station as a truck was blocking the entrance. Luckily we were able to pull into one spot. Overall, not much to do around the lot."
"630am on a Saturday morning. I’m literally the only Tesla here. Can’t get higher than 45-60kW (180-220 mi/hr). I tried 3 different stalls, all the same. And I parked near box which is usually faster. But nope. I know part of it is b/c I didn’t need a full charge so the closer to full the battery charges, the slower it charges, but still slower than usual.

Collins street bakery has nice, clean restrooms (opens 7am everyday, except Sunday opens noon), but they stopped offering a free coffee/drink to Tesla owners, FYI.  Easy walk to Whataburger."
7 charging stations right by the Dairy Queen off highway.
"7 stalls, pull in, 150kW, currently .31 per kW.
Olive Garden parking lot to use the restroom, mall is 5 min walking distance."
"7 stalls.  2 free after I pulled in at 5:30PM on a Tuesday.  Although my adjacent spots are full, I'm still pulling 70kW.  No complaints."
"7/2/19 = Close to freeway and food restaurants , good to stop even late night because Denny's is open 24hrs everyday and good outlet mall too . They have 20 ports ."
"72kw shouldn't be considered a Supercharger, and no thanks, I won't be paying to park. Save your time and money and go to Grove City if it's along the route."
72kw so not terribly fast. Chargers are located on second floor of parking structure.plenty of spaces to charge
79kW charging a Model 3 at 45%. Tried 3 different stalls. This V3 250 kW charger is performing worse than the older models for some reason.
8 250 kW Tesla Superchargers available. Walkable from Bob’s Burgers and brew and Fairfield Marriott (for restrooms).
8 250kW Superchargers located. Walkable from Gas Station next door and a Starbucks. Recommend using this one rather than the one behind the Starbucks due to faster charge speeds.
8 at a new Hampton Inn. The hotel also had 2 other Tesla chargers and 2 other EV chargers for guests.
8 changing stations which includes a pull through for trailers and a pull up too.  Clean modern restrooms.  Grocery store with deli.
"8 chargers inside casey’s general
Store parking lot. Nothing else to do in the area. Quick access, doesn’t seem as busy as the other charging station in champaign."
"8 chargers just off I-95 at a Texaco station with a Stuckey's convenience store that houses a Dairy Queen. Bathroom was a bit gross but, hey, at least it was working! Depending on how you feel about guns and machismo, you will either feel right at home here or anxious to leave."
"8 chargers rated at 250kW, very clean and friendly people in the community center. To enter restrooms, enter the front of the community center and take the steps down. Restrooms are at the far left when going down the stairs."
8 chargers/2 banks (250kW split between 4 Teslas). Hotel has picnic area and dog cleanup supplies. No squeegee or garbage but garbage can short walk away at hotel. Fairly secluded. Target very close. Pretty busy already.
8 charging spots . Neat and clean . Very near the free way .
8 charging stalls that were completely empty at 5PM on a Wednesday. Located behind a Hy-Vee grocery store which has a food court with a wide variety dining options.
8 Charging station here! Charging at 250kw!
"8 charging stations for Tesla cars.  Like most Tesla stations in a mall, they are a little bit of a walking distance from the mall itself but then close chargers in some malls like Volta chargers (usually in the front spaces of the mall) are taken up by non EV vehicles or taken up by EV vehicles that don’t leave the spot for hours.  They are several eateries that can be walked to like Menlo Park pizza and McDonald’s.  You can eat inside Menlo Park when open.  You can walk a little further to the Menlo Park Diner.  If you dare cross the big 3 lane/2 lane (5 lanes in either direction) street you can get to a Panera’s, sonic, and White Castle as well as a Margarita’s Mexican Restaurant.  Seasons 24 is also close by as well.  There is a 7-11 nearly as well.  Late at night you eating options are the Menlo Park diner or you can pick up White Castle or McDonald’s before you park to charge.  I’m not sure if the sonic will return to 24 hour service again post COVID.

If people complain that the charging stations are too far from the mall.  No one is enforcing if a gas car parks in an EV charge spot…. That’s why the charging spot for Tesla and EVGo are isolated from the mall.  No one else is going to want to park there.  If you need an example, go to nearby Woodbridge mall and see if you can ever get into the Volta charging stations in front of the Macy’s.  Or even if an EV car is parked in those spaces.  Every time I’ve gone they have never been available… why?  The two chargers are right in front of the entrance to Macy’s there and prime parking spots.  A similar problem can happen on WaWa on Route 9 where large trucks and other vehicles will block or take up the charge spots because they simply don’t care"
8 charging stations here.  7 are back in and 1 is pull in.  Right next to Wawa which is super convenient.  You can even walk over to Home Depot also but be mindful of the 15 minute limit here. I was charging at 55kW. It was the only stall available.  My first time charging at a Super Charger.  Very cool.
"8 charging stations, next to a WaWa."
8 fast superchargers with empty spots during my morning trip
8 free ststions all working but one. Next to gas station with a convenient store & option to clean your windshield.
8 Level 3 stations with 16 parking spots right beside some many hotels with food options like Zaxby's and Mellow Mushroom.
8 New super charger.  Lots more f shops around if you need a full charge.   Bright lights at night. But nothing open after 9.  There are a few restaurants a little walk away.
8 of 10 Jim score..  Holiday Inn and Black Bear restaurant within walking distance.
"8 Ports FAST Superchargers near many stores including Sam's (closest), Walmart and many many more. There are food places but require a little walk. At night can use 24/7 Walmart for bathroom.
Long time the exit and return to HWY 80."
"8 Ports FAST Superchargers nearby Woodman's Markets where there is free WiFi and bathroom open 24/7 :-) .
Store is huge so fast way to find bathrooms at Main entrance is by entering into the left side and walking outside. See pictures.
Easy & off and back onto HWY 80"
8 Ports FAST Superchargers with 1 easy forward drive-in port. Long and not easy drive off highway to get to it. Near gas station and many food places that even has gambling machines.
8 Ports FAST Superchargers with 1 easyforward near HyVee supermarket. Arranged in 2 groups of 4. Not so easy to get off and back onto HWY 80
8 Ports FAST Superchargers with 1 easyforward near HyVee.
8 spots and all are working and not crowded like the other ones. Perfect for my monthly trip down the turnpike to Middlesex county.  Will be stopping here instead of Woodbridge or Edison
"8 spots in garage, next to Safeway.  None in use at 6 am.  Drain the swamp !"
"8 stalls 250 kWh. Nice Travel Center, easy on and off. About 20+ miles north of Waco. Nice alternative to the Waco stop."
"8 stalls backside and f Wawa, enter from Sebring Pkwy across from hospital"
8 stalls behind a Sheetz. Clean restroom. Lots of dining tables inside and out. Not walking distance to anything yet. Construction nearby for new businesses.
8 stalls in a convenient place. Lots of food and shopping around. Barely any wait time.
8 stations and it's right beside the casino if anyone thinks they're lucky while they're charging .
8 superchargers right off the freeway. You can walk over to the casino for restaurants and restrooms. Plenty of grass to let the pets out to stretch their little paws. It would be nice if there were a couple trees for shade.
"8-01-22 charged Tesla model Y 48 amps  at 208V.

Signs states for customers, however they are closed today. So I couldn’t give back, will  stop by later this week and see if they open"
"8/21 update:  looks like Tesla realized this location needs more bandwidth and is adding 8 more stalls. Changed to 5 stars.

Great location, pretty much in the middle between Houston and Dallas.  This allows me to skip the absolute horrible Supercharger location in Huntsville.  Woody’s is a short walk away for refreshments and restroom.  Minus 1 star for being only 4 stalls as this is getting to be a very busy charging stop.  Hopefully Tesla installs more stalls here in the near future."
80% usage should be an optional not automatically and it’s high cost this location .
80A charge?! Yes please...thank you Best Western!
"8kw charging station, don't use to plan your trip."
8kw...
8pm very busy station forcing you to limit charge to 80%. Not so great when I will get to my destination with 8%. If you are traveling East on I-40 go to the Mount Juliet Supercharger.
"8x 150kw supercharger

while you wait for the charge, you could take a short walk by Green River or check out the John Wesley Powell River History Museum.

You will not have bathroom access if the museum is closed."
"8x 250kw supercharger.

Please note it is in the back of the building off the main road. You need to go deep in the back. 41 cent per kw."
"8x v3 (250kW / ""Superfast) Superchargers and Sheetz's tasty MTO food. It's a match made in heaven in an excellent location off of I-95!  Definitely the stop for night time travel too!

The great thing about the fast v3 stalls is that by the time you use the (usually) clean toilets, place an order for hot food and then receive it, your Tesla is done with its snack and is good for the next leg of your trip. This Sheetz, like most others, has fantastic staff, a clean layout, and toilets you can access 24/7 (unlike strip mall based charging stops). It's also large enough to have an eating area so if you want to chill for a little longer and enjoy your greasy messy Big Mozz sandwich or something you can do so without getting your car all dirty. :)

Traffic can be a little heavy at times, since this is a very good location for any kind of fueling up, but bonus points for putting the charging stalls near the drive-thru lane. Most of the non-tesla traffic on this side of the building is in the separate drive way to place the order which makes pulling into a spot a little easier. This partnership with Sheetz just gets better and smarter all the time!

Not quite the best spot to charge before bailing onto 295 and avoiding the Richmond mess, but it's not far. You can do a short hop back to get to 295 or take the major local roads to meet back up with it!"
95% of the time the chargers are running at there full 150kwh. The going charge rate here is $0.25 per kwh. Very nice charging location and it has a pretty good view you can also go into the hotel for a bite to eat or for a drink very nice.
"9th floor. Rated at 12A (very slow). Sometimes, non electric vehicles take the spot."
A 12 stall V3 supercharger with many nearby food options!  I have charged here a few times and never had any issues.
"A bit crowded especially during the middle of the day, be careful parking in the whole lot honestly my cars been hit so many times on the doors by someone else. Also don't over use they do call and will tow your vehicle.."
"A bit far from the major stores and eateries, but is about a 10-15 minute walk. it’s a decent supercharger. No issues with charging."
"A bit of a destination off US97, right at the Fred Meyer and close to the gas station ⛽️.

Glad Tesla is starting to put a spot for disabled access use, this should be a standard in all of the Superchargers across the world."
A bit of a maze to find at first. Doesn't hit 120KW but 72KW is fine. The key is having a reliable supercharger and parking is free.
"A bit of an odd location here, but nice in a sense to get to drive through the middle of the city on 1A even when just passing through. Chargers are always reliable and having the Sobeys grocery store nearby is convenient when they are open too. Wish this charger was closer to a gas station with 24/7 services and with the ability to clean a windshield though."
"A bit off the highway. Clean, fast. Wawa stop (with Jersey made pork roll!)"
"A bit off the I-70 but conveniently located a short walk from Target, Petco, natural grocers, and a bunch of other shops in Glenwood Springs mall. Didn’t see much to eat in the area though. Clean bathrooms located in the Courtyard Marriott right opposite the chargers. Only 6 chargers and tends to get crowded during the weekend."
A bit on the slow side but at least Wawa is right near by for a quick stop
"A bit slow and crowded but a Statbuck, Panera, and McDonalds right there."
"A bit slower than others, though easy to get into. Not the best signage being that they are in the parking structure. Wish they had clear signage of nearby necessities such as bathroom, trash, etc."
A bit tough to find and you have to sit through a line at the gate to the parking lot.  Staff was nice and didn't make us pay for parking since we were just charging.  The Stanley grounds were fun to walk through while we waited.  There is a coffee shop and decent bathrooms in the Stanley that anyone can use.
"A bit tricky to find; look for Earl's Kitchen. The stations are next to its parking lot. (If you go past Earl's GPS will take you up to the Polo Park 2nd level parking lot... Aside from the location, the charger operation is fine. I visited twice and both times there were plenty of stations free (only three in use)."
"A clean, well lit area with 5 chargers available. Not very busy on the day we visited. Pretty accesible from the main road. Car charged very quickly."
A convenient charger just down the street from my house. The little playground is nice for the kids. Coffee across the street is good (Bean Grinders). Subway and a grocery store are a bit of a walk down the street; not as close as you'd like but fine in good weather.
"A convenient location but hard to find, on the lowest level."
A couple idiots parked their gas cars in the charging spots but not a big deal. Next to a Dunkin.
"A couple miles off the highway at a Casey's. Need to visit here if you're on a week long business trip in Danville (which has has no EV chargers, at least not until the casino is built)."
"A couple of miles further out of town there is a 250kw charger. Twice the speed, with restaurants.

Check prices on the Tesla dashboard. Dang, Roseville is expensive!"
"A decent charging location. You won't have many options for food and shopping. If you have enough juice, skip here and charge up at the Casey's supercharger at Van Buren. It is a busier intersection but you will have many more options while you wait."
"A decent, if slightly slow, charger. All stalls were functional. Applebee's and Holiday Inn Express are all that's nearby. There's a large gravel area in front of the chargers where kids and dogs can run around, but it's nothing fancy."
"A Female driver purposely holds two supercharging stations forcing drivers to wait for available one deliberately and dangerously. When she was asked to move her car in designated parking charg station, she refused and returns back to her vehicle. I was forced to squeeze in between hers and another Tesla in order to park and charge my vehicle. This kind of behavior should not be tolerated by Tesla because it is not fair one individual to hold two charging spot while other drivers are waiting for available charging stations."
A few fast food options nearby. Upgraded chargers. Plenty of space to walk around with a dog.
"A few stations don't work, doesn't make sense that they are not reported on the app, and take you away from a good experience."
A few years back this was an excellent stop for charging but they no longer maintain these stations very well.  At least one has been broken the last couple times we have been there.  And last Christmas 3 were broken.  This location has also become very busy with no upgrades or improvements to the site.  Pretty disappointed Tesla hasnt provided better service in this area with it being at the crossroads of 2 major interstates and in such a highly traveled location of the US.
"A fun place to stop for some real Americana!  The Workmans Gas station has an awesome little store, clean bathrooms, and a restaurant with made to order food. They also have a case of already made things - and everything is fried!  Vegans stay away from this place. We had them make sandwiches from Boars Head brand deli things which took a long time, but our hearts thanked us. The charger is a 250. Fast!"
"A fun stop that commemorates Casey Jones, complete with a small museum and “The Old Country Store” restaurant and “Dixie Cafe”. If you love fried everything this is your place!"
"A good amount of chargers on the far end of Target parking lot. So you can shop while you charge! There is also a Longhorn, Panerai, nail shop, ice cream shop, etc. if you like to do things while your car charges"
"A good charger. There's a Burger King next door and a Walmart a couple blocks away. If you're staying the night, there are two hotels adjacent."
"A good number of charging points, a mile of the freeway. Only the gas station quick kiosks around, so not much options for food. But Good for a quick charge"
"A good spot to stop and charge before heading across the rest of the Ohio Turnpike. Plenty of spots to charge at night......when we were here during the day there was a small queue due to options for charging being limited in parts of the state.

A few minutes down the road are some good spots to eat if you are looking for vegan or vegetarian options - we highly recommend Aladdin's!"
A good super charger for on the way to Fredericksburg.  It’s a short walk to a coffee shop called “fuel.“ And there are a couple of restaurants nearby. One of them is the Trailblazer Grille where we had cowboy chicken and a Philly cheesesteak sandwich.
A great charging option slightly north of Eugene. In the parking lot of a winery tasting room. The staff is very friendly and often offers free wine samples. They also have a nice food truck. The bathrooms are clean and private. Check the station details in your car for the passcode.
A great charging spot. Everything clean and in working order
"A great location right next to a dinner an a Village center , Easy on and off route 17. Total of 8 stalls did not see a lot of cars here . Quick 150kWh charging"
"A great location to charge, next to a restaurant, hotels, and has a trash. Parking lot is tricky but quiet and clean."
A great place to charge while walking around the Sonoma square.
"A great place to charge.  Located at the Fort, a Sinclair gas station, the charging station has trash cans and squeegees to clean your windshield.  We charged here specifically to avoid charging at the lame Billings supercharger."
"A great place to stop at night to charge, eat and even sleep. So many food choices: Cracker Barrel, Taco Bell, KFC, Arby's, a Chinese Buffet and more. Lots of empty charging bays. Then for those who may have been driving all day and need a place to sleep there's: Hampton Inn, RedRoof Inn, Best Western and a Quality Inn three miles up the road."
"A lifesaver near VTech. The hotel provides two Tesla 2.4 chargers for dual charging 24/7 conveniently located left of the main entrance. Even though it is not a supercharger, the 20-25 miles/hour charge is fast enough for hotel guests to get a full charge overnight, or for Tesla owners on a pinch trying to get to the closest supercharging station is in Salem, about 31 miles from Blacksburg."
"A little bit exposed to the main street, but fine otherwise."
A little bit off the main road but a nice spot to stop and charge.  Area to walk dogs and sheets has good food and bathrooms.  4 stars because one of my stops here another Tesla indicated they were only charging at 70kwh until there were only 2 of us left.
"A little difficult to find due to construction and the Tesla’s weird map routing.

Located in the Mexican restaurant parking lot. Slower (120 kw?) and nothing walkable besides a hotel."
"A little difficult to find, but once found, it was great!"
"A little far from 95 relative to other locations along the highway, but a good location at Sheetz which offers a fairly clean bathroom and decent drink and food selections."
A little far from the interstate. Only got ~40-50kW and there were two pickup trucks parked in charging spots (plenty of other parking).
A little hard to find at first - in underground parking garage for the supermarket - but all chargers worked at fastest speed of any chargers in area.
"A little off the beaten path, however ample and effective towards the point. Numerous stations, lots of businesses near by.

Pictured w/2 separate Handicapped Stations which offer more moving room and > spacious parking."
A little off the interstate. Just need to grab food/stop at a convenience store before heading there. Not really walkable. But great spot to charge and go to the bathroom in the hotel.
A little sketchy. Smelled overwhelmingly of urine. I gave this review 2 stars because the Carl's Jr was good and had clean bathrooms.
"A little slow at first, reading an hour on what should have been 30 minutes. We switched to the second stall from the right and it went to 30 minutes. The stalls up fast once we arrived, so it seems to be a busy location. There are tons of amenities nearby such as McDonalds, Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks, a grocery store and some other shopping."
"A little slow, maybe they haven't uped the power yet? But it is a welcome addition to the network."
A little tricky getting there coming from the 95 south lanes. But it a great place Wawa bathroom and food and good coffee.
A lot of chargers. Get the full 250. The Buc EE's has a lot of food choices; I would say best food option in the Carolinas within walking distance from a super charger. clean bathrooms
A lot of open spots. Good size convenience store and a Subway.
A lot of things to do in the area and a good amount of chargers. Well lit at night time. It is a decently fast charger and I have never had to wait here. It is great if you need a quick Target run as well!
"A nice location behind a Sheetz, so less chance of getting ICEd. It’s really in Opal, not Bealeton. I had the place to myself. I like that there’s a option to avoid the DC traffic on road trips."
A nice place to charge but we came around 11am and the two restaurants weren’t open yet for bathroom use. Lots of places to shop though.
"A nice supercharger in the parking lot of Winn Dixie, restrooms are in the back right corner.  A couple of trashcans to keep the place tidy which is a plus.  A few places to eat within the same parking lot, Checkers, Burger King, and Hungry Howie's, but Checkers was drive thru only.  If you want to walk across the street there are a few more options."
A nice town to browse through.
"A previous reviewer said that this supercharger is hard to get to if heading south...of course, since this is the northbound supercharger. If you're heading south on I-93 just use the supercharger at the southbound rest area. There's a supercharger at BOTH the northbound and southbound rest areas."
A quick bite to eat and charge in the same amount of time. Can't beat it.
A quick charging while we went and picked some groceries from Meijer
A real fast charger with 120kw and plenty to do around here. Restaurants and mejier
A real supercharger at 250 Kw charge the car in 20 minutes at a rate of thousand miles per hour! Clean area and the owner of the space - sheetz maintains the place clean and safe.
"A really super supercharging station. 12, 250kW and 12, 150kW Superchargers. A good spot to get a bite to eat. In a busy shopping center parking lot. Great selection and wide variety of shops and restaurants within walking distance."
"A shiny new Supercharger with 12x fast (250kW) chargers. Instead of one or two row of chargers, Walterboro has 4 rows of parking slots (2x rows of back to back parking spots) which means if you're hauling a trailer you can pull across one row to park and still keep most of the charging spots open!  (Yes it does have a ""pull in"" spot, but when the parking spot is still normal length it leaves your trailer blocking the parking row).

It's right off 95, in a big strip-mall shopping center so you have lots of options to eat at, like KFC, or Poppa John's or IHOP. You've got GameStop and Dollar Tree if you need to pick up something to keep your passengers occupied, and there's a Walmart Supercenter at the end of the road in case you need anything else.  All in all, this stop offers a lot of places to charge very quickly, and a lot to do while you're here. If there's a downside, is that if you arrive late late at night, past normal store hours (the Walmart closes at 11pm) most of your places to go to the bathroom shut down too. Best bet is to try asking at the Super 8 that's there."
"A short hop south of Rte.#1 off Main St. N. Another location that you have to circle back to get to if approaching from the TCH because it's on your left and partially hidden by the Canadian Brewhouse and Starbucks.
(Look for the big Civic  Centre Plaza sign.) The first charger I used (1B) seemed a little slow but they work..."
"A strategically placed station close to the highway that we use all the time when driving across I80/90. Usually busy but we’ve never waited to use a stall. Food options include Chipotle, Deet’s BBQ, Steak Escape, Tropical Smoothie Cafe, & Sakura Express (don’t go there!). Taco Bell, Meijers, and others are a short walk."
"A super duper charger near some decent fast food so you can charge, eat and go. Also in the parking lot of the grocery store, perfect for any quick meal prep grabs.

The few times the charger has been out of service it was fixed in a timely manner (hours not days)."
"A supercharger should be evaluated for the speed it provides in comparison to what it’s listed speed is. I’m the only one at the chargers at 11:34PM and I’m getting 69kW instead of the 150kW this charger is capable of.

And the parking lot is lit up like a night game at Yankee Stadium. Good luck napping."
"A Target this close to a super charger is the dream, but you do have to walk to it as the super chargers are really around the corner. Would recommend it for restrooms but late at night I could see the walk being a little off putting"
A tesla charging station that worked
A ton of spots available! Really high speeds throughout. Huge area to walk around and stretch. If you're hungry there's a Carl's junior. Not much options around. Cell reception is good with 5g and 3 bars. Real close to the freeway.
A truck stop gas station in the middle of Alabama. Lots of people parked in the Tesla charging spots. It’s covid era and no one in the gas station is wearing a mask— not even the employees— which truly just feels reckless and gross compared to every other place in America I’ve been. There’s dog poop all over the grass. Not a fan.
"A very convenient location off of I-5 near a hotel, restaurant, and more.  Often busy but I've never had to wait."
A very convenient place to stop and recharge. LOL
A very scenic supercharger location. Right next to the ski slopes. These are 72kW chargers so a Model S gains 240 mi/hr instead of the 300+.
A walk to the park on the River is a great way to spend time while charging up. There is also a small beach to swim at the river.
A washroom and a pull in spot is very much appreciated for a supercharger. Specially in the country where people tow stuff all the time
"A week later, 3/13 5a was not working, said there was no power.  This place needs shade...

Why are they so slow!?  36kw 138 mi/hr and there was only two of us here at one point and it's maintained the slowness 🤦🏽‍♀️"
A welcome addition when yermo/lenwood are full. Lots of good food around it too. Car finished charging before my food came out
Able to pick up some snacks and top off my sons tesla. We were there about 15 min. Cost him about $8.00.
About 1 or 2 min off I-10. At a Valero. Good place to grab Food or Drinks.  Stretch and use the restroom if needed.  Not too crowded but lots of sketchy people loitering in this area.
"About 10 chargers here, right next to Starbucks so you can get some coffee and use the rest room. There are a bunch of gas stations around here too if you need to buy something."
"Absolutely, love these chargers. Thank you, thank you, thank you for having these available. These are amazing and close to the convenient store."
Access to hotel bathroom but in a creepy dystopian landscape complete with tumbleweeds and an abandoned 1973 Planet of the Apes-esk movie theater.
Access to many things there
Access via 21c hotel valet parking only - at $32 / night
"According to the owner, these charging stations will remain open, even with the closure of the museum. They are 11kW so likely the best you are going to find in the area. Very much appreciated, I dropped in at the mechanic shop in the back and let them know how grateful I was considering my hotel is just a few blocks away. Great eye candy too, even if you can only peek in through the windows!"
Across the street from Taco Bell and other restaurants. Got the job done and good lunch
"Actually visited the Sheetz gas station at which the Tesla Superchargers are located....did not use the ""superchargers"", but did use the facilities at the Sheetz station....this seems to be an older Sheetz location, and it is showing its age....the inside of the store was not very well lighted, and seemed sort of dreary....the mens room was in need of a good cleaning...I ordered a burger; it was served barely warm (I picked up my order as soon as it was called) and the meat patties (I ordered ""double meat"") were tasteless, and looked more gray than brown. On the plus side, the coffee was good and fresh, and the gas was reasonably priced."
Address is not correct. Go to the parking lot directly left of the CVS pharmacy at Mashpee Commons.
Advertised as a 250 and I got it up to 206 and eventually settled at around 160kW. It's in Hilton hotel parking lot. You'll need to go through the lobby area parking and then head to the side of the hotel parking to get to the charging stations. Cell reception is ok at 5g with 2 bars (AT&T). There are several areas to eat and pretty walkable. There is also grassy areas for dogs to do their business. Didn't need to use the bathroom so I can't comment on that.
"Advertises as a 250kW charger, but with no one else charging I tried three different units and could not get about 55kW"
After 2 hours looking for Tesla charger still had to wait to charge. We tried 4 other charges & they don't fit Tesla charger.  Need more chargers & or adapt to fit other charges
After couple month using a Tesla. Cars have a lot of factory defects and they do not stand behind warranty. Battery downgrading extremely fast. Tesla customer service and dealers are useless and careless.
"After driving an electric car with not many chargers near where I live, the Tesla superchargers are awesome. Too bad it's close to about 30 mi from where I live so I'm constantly having to go back and forth.

Besides that, there's not many other options for quick charging in my area. But once you get there it's 0 to 100 real quick!

Please add more along the Grand strand"
"After driving in from our Airbnb in Tampa, we charged up here before spending the day at Disney. There are a bunch of bays, access to nice restrooms and the charges are level 3 and the fastest. Would recommend if you're wanting to top off before a day at the parks."
"After hearing about the ICEing, we were concerned about getting a much needed charge for the uphill climb to Santa Fe. Luckily there was only one idiot parked here. The rest of the bays were empty."
"After recently buying my first Tesla, I went to FSU for my son's graduation & was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the charger puts on the miles & also how clean it was. Actually made the trip enjoyable instead of dreading to go. The superchargers are also conveniently located with plenty to eat either at your location or very close. Only downside was the rate was 3 1/2 times more than I pay for electricity at home but the entire round-trip still cost less than half what it used to in any of my previous cars."
Again easy peasy. All chargers were working. There was no wait. Feel like I am in an abandoned parking lot and wasn't really aware that there was a kind of strip mall attached to this lot. Kind of feels like it's overgrown and that construction has been abandoned. I might check out the mall next time I'm there.
Agree with the above. Box is turned off. No sense in driving all the way there only to find out that it's not working. It could be disasterous for someone.
"Ain't got no lectric conveyance . Had a laugh at them fellers that were there. Cuz they was there before I got to the store, l was in there for awhile, when l left they was still pumping that good Ole lectricity in them thar cars. To them fellers all I can say is ""get a horse.""  If yall know history ya know what I mean."
All 4 chargers Out of order november 2021
"All 8 stations were full, we had to wait almost half an hour!"
"All chargers are broken. Booked this hotel specifically to charge overnight and no luck. I told the front desk and they thought only one was out of order. I informed them they are all broken, physically damaged, and clearly need full replacement. Call ahead and see if they actually fixed them before you book."
"All chargers available
No waiting"
All chargers online - 140kw and 560 miles / hr rate with 18% SOC. Status was correct on nav screen.  Also - 4 new terminals that have no numbers and ? Are not paired.  Generic EV chargers there as well.
All chargers open. Dunkin is in the same parking lot. convenient
All chargers were up and running it's right next to a Wawa so you can use the bathroom grab a drink while you wait
All chargers working
"All is great, except it’s a 150kw charger, not 250!"
"All new dedicated chargers (no sharing half speed) located in lot by front of Marriott. Walkable to three eateries, and has nice green space for pets."
"All of the chargers were working. The entrance was congested due to the nearby WaWa. But, that’s also the benefit of it being there. There’s somewhere to go while charging. I’ll go back if I’m in the area."
All of the parking spaces nearby are reserved with towing signs and often occupied by non electric vehicles.
ALL of the spaces were blocked by badly parked SUVs on a Sunday morning. One illegally parked owner was at least decent enough to tell the front desk she had parked illegally and came down after 20 minutes to move. The hotel needs MUCH better signage to address this.
"All of the stations would not work to charge, no other vehicles were there, obviously. Tesla navigation never rerouted us, this was a serious inconvenience."
All reviews correct. Just did a PA-AZ round trip and best charging site I’ve visited! Max’s treats you like royalty. Worth a stop even if you don’t need it.
All stalls are operational max of 150kW. Enjoy a Wawa 🥪 and ☕ to recharge as your car charges as well. This Wawa is always busy so be cautious when backing into your stall especially for stalls 3A/B and 4A/B.
All stalls working. Convenient store is nice with clean restrooms.
All stations were operational & open.
All Tesla drivers should by all means avoid this supercharging station. It is the most ridiculous setting: just behind a stay-alone restaurant and the restaurant will not allow charging station user to even use their bathroom. There is no other stores or facilities that you can use to walk around. The charging station is also old with 45kw capacity and it will take long time to charge. There are many other charging station within 20 miles.
All Tesla Supercharger stations are great. Massachusetts has cheapest stations.
"All the chargers are functional. The gas station, stores and restaurants are still under construction. (Oct 1, 2022)
Lots of space and there was a cop on duty. Not sure what that was for but I guess it stops people from vandalizing the chargers.
Once the gas station and stores are open, I will update it to 5 stars.

I see several reviews where the say they charged at 250 KW, I was only getting 56 KW both time (AM and PM)."
All the chargers are working and sheets has all that is needed. There is a hobby lobby etc very close by
All the chargers failed this morning. All Tesla’s went red. Please check this charger.
"All the chargers were open and working but be aware they are tucked away. You really cannot spot them until you're almost right on top of them. Even with my Tesla's GPS I made two wrong turns.

Once there are though, easy peasy, in out, lemon squeezy. I expect nothing less of Tesla super charging stations."
"All the spots were occupied by Teslas when I got there in a Friday night, but one left just shortly after I got there. Cars come and go as they finish. The Wendy's and service center closes at 9pm."
"All the stations are positioned so that you have to back in. Which is fine for the Teslas stations, but the flo stations are positioned for this as well, and my port is at the front. Would be a difficult maneuver to get in had it been busy as it is tight."
"All you need. Good location, near some shops. Well lit, even well at night you don't feel like it's a sketchy spot. In a hotel lot, plenty of open charging stalls and I got up to 110kW on 3A. Only complaint is the closest restroom is to walk over to the shops, but other than that I was really happy iwth the in and out nature of this SC setup"
"Almost all stalls were taken but surprisingly, the charging was extremely fast. No place to use the restroom or grab a bite to eat so everyone was sitting in the car."
"Almost never crowded
WaWa is great."
"Almost on 64 on your way to/from Outer Banks.  Holiday Inn & Bojangles, that’s it.  Little slower than other SC I’ve used."
"Almost was on empty in okachobee, but made it here to full charge! Model 3 performance, beating the brakes off of 392 chargers.😉"
"Along the street on the side of Car Toys, well lit at night but was messy with shopping carts when visited."
"Also affiliated with the Amway Grand Hotel.
4 Tesla charger spots (and 2 regular ev spots)"
Also has 2 FLO chargers.  They work but not located in FLO app yet.  Station ID’s AAL-00767 and AAL-00651.  App shows them in Neepawa but they are in Morris attached to the Tesla Chargers
"Also has a couple of J1772 connectors. If you call ahead, they might let you plug-in while you get some lunch."
Also has a J1772 station but 2 Tesla chargers are available 😁
"Also have one charging station for my Ford Fusion plugin. Attached to mega convenient store and a restaurant. I can't seem to drive by without stopping, maybe because of the clean bathroom!?"
"Altamonte is a very good charging station. Charging starts around 105kw, area is pleasant and seems safe. Restrooms are easily accessible at Whole Foods and there is a beautiful park within walking distance during longer charges."
"Although charging is a bit on the slow side it's a decent enough Supercharger. It can be kind of busy at times since it only has 6 chargers, it's also the only Supercharger on I-40 between Santa Rosa and Gallup, it also serves the I-25 corridor. It's in the parking lot of an Applebee's restaurant, so if the restaurant is open, food and a bathroom are available, otherwise, it's pretty bleak. There is a multistory Holiday Inn Express next door."
"Although Elon's particularly piney musk was once known to only a few early adopters of the odor, nowadays many embrace the pungent aroma of the world's smartest Man-child and the only known aspy amateur astrophysicist to have successfully reproduced, much as those base package model 3 plebians hogging spots and greasing up the supercharger handles and sucking down my sweet oxygen are wont to do. Indeed our S's and their lack of emissions prove with certainty that our byproducts do not offend the nostrils nearly as much as those dilettantes, charlatans, and sycophants who drive Priuses or *shudder* Leafs.

Usually a breeze, but I had to wait with the masses recently...I mean not with anybody with a car under $40k luckily--that's the OTHER side of the lot folks."
"Although its in front of a hotel, it is not nearby any store or bathroom. There is gas stations around but you have to cross the street (no crosswalk for pedestrians either). But its all good."
"Always a free spot when needed! Next to Starbucks, Gyro place and pizzeria. Nice quick stop"
Always a good charge here at the Ludington Meijer. You'll meet friendly local owners and enjoy working chargers. I believe they've all been fixed now. You can always walk across the street to grab a beer at Applebee's!
Always a good place to stop since it's on a Wawa property that's open 24hrs.  Didn't have any issues with the charger and the store had good clean bathrooms.
Always a great charging experience at these super chargers!
Always a great experience
"Always a great experience here. Easy, fast charging. Close enough to target for bathroom breaks and food options. Can get busy at times, but usually no more than a short wait."
Always a great stop to charge up the car. Located with a Sheetz that usually has clean bathrooms and decent food for a gas station.
Always a lot of spots available to charge at! While waiting in my car and having lunch I had two people come up and ask questions about my Model S. I was happy to answer all their questions 😊
Always a spot available. Very convenient and close to my house. I go here often at night!
"Always a spot for me, no garbage containers,  kinda hidden and dark behind the meijer"
Always a spot open at the 8 spot.  HyVee and Starbucks and many other stores and shops right here.  Such a convenient location.  Unfortunately this is the only Tesla Supercharger in Lincoln.
Always a spot open for me to charge and there is a garbage can with windshield cleaner available.
"Always a wait because rentals are being charged all day, everyday. Hey rental companies - install chargers on your own lots!"
Always a wait here. Only 6 chargers and one wasn’t working!! Wish I had my gas car!!
Always able to get a spot and charging is fast. Only Supercharger in the area.
Always all stations are full there’s 4-5cars waiting in line - not a good spot if you don’t have extra time in hand ( pics are of 2-diff days at diff times) always full 🥹
"Always an opening. Nice well clean area, very safe"
Always available chargers any time of day or night. My fave one to visit. 🫶🏼👍👍👍👍
Always available safe place lot to do around there in just a couple blocks off I-75
"Always been open and available (and able to charge to my desired 90%) whenever I go. 8 stations inside the parking garage, no ticket/fee to enter garage. Plus, service in the garage to watch Netflix or whatever while you wait if you're a quick shopper!"
"Always busy! When I first bought my Tesla I loved it but now since everyone is buying one, it suxs. Superchargers all getting filled up all the time and you may have to wait hours. Right now I’m looking at a two hour wait. Tesla seems like they abandoned the charging infrastructure. Left people like me that invested early on high and dry."
"Always charge here at midnight, with averaging 3-4 cars. I always charge where the road is behind me. I'm not sure but I feel safer as there are times there was this non EV car checking Tesla. I reverse so it can't see my plate. Idk. Oh well"
Always clean and in perfect order!
Always easy to pull in and just start charging.   On my last visit I charged my model 3 performance from 20 to 80 percent in about 30 minutes.   It's located directly in front of Hy-Vee so it's easy to let the car charge while shopping for groceries.
Always easy. Love the new faster sites!
"Always empty, can always get a charger without any waiting. Clean and well lit area. Restroom at Firehouse Subs are always clean."
Always good to charge the car before a drive a few businesses nearby to go to whilr you wait while you vehicle charges
"Always good, always working - reliability baby!"
Always great to charge at park meadows mall. Time goes quickly.
Always has plenty of charger stalls available to charge.
Always have had an open parking spot. Clean and well lit. Really nice it's next to Target and Steak n Shake.
"Always here by myself or with 1 other car, never crowded. 150 kW is ok, and gives you time to walk to the Igloo, a classic small-town fast food place.
Does what it's supposed to, and then on your way."
Always is clean and the Sheetz gas station is open 24/7 they do have seating/eating area inside. Nice area to stop and take a break from the road and of course to charge up your Tesla
"Always like to stop here because of pea soup Andersen’s proximity. Interstate five is exactly say that, and a bit noisy, but the restaurant in Supercharger convenience is awesome."
Always more than 7 stalls are available. Clean safe area right by the hotel. Just great just like everything Tesla does. Not sure why someone else here had to give it one star without any explanation. Oh and this supercharged is right by freighters which is a great restaurant.
Always occupied
Always open and fast charging. If you need a full charge be prepared to walk a little if you leave for food or a drink.
"always open, good place to charge while shopping at woodmans."
Always packed and it never gets above 40kw.
Always packed but people were courteous and quick to charge both times I visited. I was four cars deep waiting the first time and I waited 20 minutes. The second time I was the second car waiting and was charging within 10 minutes. There's a Starbucks in the same plaza just around the corner (~1min walk).
Always place to charge your Tesla. Never saw it busy.
Always space and always working.  MUCH better than Electrify America chargers around here.
Always spots available. Trash cans are emptied often. There is a dog walking area in the front and the building on the far end has a nice cafe. I always make sure to stop in on my travels.
"Always stalls available, it's a big lot. Right next to all the goodies and entertainment. Be sure to visit Dan's market on the same parking lot, go all the way to the back where the deli and bakery are and get anything with apples - yum!
Leavenworth is a tourist destination and this charger is right smack in the middle of it. At night, every time I parked there, a police car drove by within a few minutes, which makes me feel extra safe, considering I pass for a white woman - I understand not everyone feels safe from police right now, so this is only my personal experience being shared good luck and godspeed."
Always working. Fills up quick certain times of the day.
Amazing
Amazing charge! We ate at the walking distance restaurant called Taps and the food was delicious (mahi tacos and California style impossible burger. Def recommend!! Currently 1A spot is not working so we had to change spots. After that we got pretty fast charge.
Amazing charger!!!
"Amazing charging stations! Finally, Buc-ees is getting in on the superchargers. Nice walking distance from the store. Spacious parking. Restrooms are as clean as always. Perfect stop just outside of Houston."
Amazing for Tesla owners to charge their teslas.
"Amazing location and multiple chargers, never had to wait for a charger, and I've been here at all hours. Clean and large bathrooms inside Bucee's with many offerings if you don't want to wait in your car."
Amazing location. Extremely happy to see Tesla expanding to the southwest side since there are many electric cars around here
Amazing my Tesla is feeling great!
"Amazing new supercharger with 8 stalls and 250kW charging!!
Great location south of Newark for UD visitors.
Only drawback is that parking is limited at this Wawa, so if it's really busy non-teslas may park in the charging spots. Almost understandable!!
Happy charging!!"
Amazing place! Great food!
"amazing Tesla supercharging  station! I took one of the last two spots. Within a minute, all 12 stations were occupied. I still got 400+ miles/ hr as the start charging rate. It is close to a shopping center. I had my dog with me and found PetSmart. Perfect experience!"
Amazing worked well no issues.
Amazing!!! Great location to stop for a charge. Can’t wait to see Tesla Supercharger in Fort Walton Beach.
"Amenities were great, fairly walkable location. This charger seemed to be running underpowered, however, never got higher than 50 kw."
"Amentities around are excellent, however chargers are almost always in use during peak hours, slow charging"
"Ample amount of super charging stations for you to charge, the place has near by eateries, places to shop and then there is a near by Red Robins where u can enjoy some yummy fries while you recharge and plan your next adventure"
"Ample chargers that deliver sufficient power even when parked next to a charging Tesla.
It would be nice to see a garbage can here as there was trash littered around some spaces. 🤨"
Ample stalls available. Everyone is good about skipping stalls and leaving once charged.
An adventure
An excellent service. It is comfortable and clean
"An insanely wide open supercharger. 12 stalls in the middle/side of a Walmart parking lot. A little surprising of a location. I wonder how difficult it will be to access/use these during peak holiday shopping season.

The only real food here, other than Walmart, is a Highway 55 burger place.

Still, 12 250kw superchargers with parking on both sides, ample room to walk dogs, and at least a few dining options; not bad."
An institution. Great food and 70s atmosphere.
An odd location and somewhat difficult to locate on your first try.  Inconvenient food and bathroom options as well since the mall and local businesses close in the evening and are quite a walk from this location.
Another eight stall supercharger located behind the hotel and gas station. Great little Mexican restaurant also.
"Another eye sore and problem put in place of a couple trees, more pollution to the land than a gasoline vehicle"
Another fast charger 20 mins for over 200 miles. Especially when none else is on the other charger next to you.
Another great charging experience.  Food and shopping with walking distance.
Another great location. Co-located with a Sheetz just off I-40.
"Another great Meijer located supercharger.  Chick-fil-a, five guys, Starbucks all within walking distance."
"Another great supercharge from the Tesla network on our Colorado, Utah, Wyoming road trip. Quick and painless as usual. Nearly 500mph. Nothing too much really close to it other than the motel to use the bathrooms."
Another great Supercharger
another mixed experience.  limped into town via winnemucca bad charge experience and it cranked at 7pm on a friday night.   stayed in town overnight and came back to top off at 8am and they charged like molasses.   tried 3 different ones and no one else was there.  Was mystified how radically the Kw changed from evening to morning
Another old gas station on the Road
"Another super convenient super charging station, right off the highway (I-81). The bathroom at this Sheetz is perhaps the worst that we’ve visited. Nonetheless, there is food and drink and bathroom a few steps away."
"Another Tesla charger at a Meijer, love it. Culver's is right next to the charger, so good food is only a 2 minute walk away. There always seems to be plenty of open spots here at this charger no matter what time you come.
Meijer closes the entrance closest to the charger at 9pm or about there, so you'll be walking to the other entrance if you want to use the restroom. Not a big deal, just more time to let your car charge.
Overall, great place and I'm happy that every charger here works."
"Another TESLA Supercharger station in the books. Lots of chargers, not busy or crowded and many food choices around. The only thing to note is that there are only two stalls in the ladies restroom inside in the Parker's Kitchen gas station 😳. Oh one more thing... there's a COSTCO."
Any charge station gets 5 stars from me just for being available...considering all the times I had to charge that awful car...
Any Tesla Supercharger in a WaWa parking lot is my first choice.  The grass area made it safe to walk my pup.
Apparently you can only find the price in a Tesla car.
"Applebees parking lot. Charging fast! About a 5 minute walk to Fuzzys Taco Shop, which is delicious. We don’t mind the walk and enjoy getting to stretch our legs and get some exercise on long road trips."
Appreciate Tesla charger to charge up on my way to visit family north of Pittsburgh.
"Area is extremely dirty and seems unsafe. Broken glass everywhere in the parking lot, trash everywhere, and lots of broken and battered cars driving around the lot ready to scratch/sideswipe you

Also access roads from freeway are horribly filled with potholes everywhere and begging to give you a flat. Only fast food options nearby, recommend the taco truck in the back of the same lot if you do come."
Area is full of restaurants from Starbucks to Chipotle to Applebees. The mall appeared clean and safety was not a concern. The charge speed was pitiful. There was a total of 3 cars charging including myself (no one on my circuit). The max I achieved was 90 Kwh then it dropped to 66. Luckily I only needed another 30 Kwh to make it home with 17% remaining charge. This charger was more expensive and slower than a previous charger that I used. Look at my other review. Five stars for places to pass the time but one star for charging capability.
"Area very clean and the chargers worked great. Fast clean energy.

The waste is another story. Battery acid, plastic housings, the miles of electrical wires coated in more plastic, yea.
Neutral genderism, The 🇺🇸 is sure glad that China and India don't use fossil fuels and we are sure that their EPA guidelines are ssoo much more strict then the USA.
Enough said."
"Arizona Sign Company owner blocked 3 out of 4 chargers here all day.  Of course he wouldn’t block the gas pumps on the other side.  Nor would he compensate me for ruined trip, missed campground or food lost in fridge.  Dairy Queen didn’t care either.  DQ owner chose not to notify Tesla, so Tesla is still routing people to the line.  This was always an undersized crowded little corner charging station, but now it’s the worst charging experience ever."
"Arrived arnd 8am on a snowy Monday (in April!) to ""fill up"" before heading to Tesla service in Portland. I was the only car here and it was quick & easy as always.."
Arrived at 230 am.    The lawn sprinklers are on and spraying into all of  the charging spots.   Not looking to take a shower while plugging in.
"Arrived at 6am. Only two other cars. 10 spots were free.
I noticed the Low speed charging even if you were the only person in the station. They increased the speed to the max of 250 for a few days; otherwise, speed is below 150 regardless of how empty the battery is."
Arrived here with under 20% battery. Not a very busy supercharger. The off-ramp exit to this supercharger is very odd off a bend on the Southern Tier Expressway…you can easily miss it!  Stopped in at Dunkin’ Donuts to use the washroom plus get coffee…not much around unless you whip around the corner….there’s a Walmart.
"Arrived near midnight so obviously no conveniences such as restrooms or food. However, probably fine during the day regarding conveniences but was not able to to advise. This location is a little difficult to find and further off the interstate than I would like. At night time seems isolated and feels less safe than other locations I’ve been to during night time charging."
Arrived on a Friday prior to the Labor Day long weekend. Place was packed and full with a couple cars waiting. Not the most convenient place to charge as you need to exit Interstate 81 and head down Binghamton’s  busy Main Street. The only positive with the location is the Sonic across the street. We ended up not charging here. I had just enough charge to make it to the Destiny shopping mall Supercharger on Syracuse.
"Arrived on a Saturday evening around 7:30.  No Teslas on site.  Once I figured out the parking situation (lines did not line up with ability to plug in) several other cars arrived.  They are in the process of fixing parking lines, evidenced by spray paint.  Charged fast, was done when we returned from a quick Walmart trip. Several places to shop or eat nearby.  Bonus to this spot is that across the lane are other EV charger types.  Smart.  Another convenient spot to charge on trips up and down WA state.  4 stars due to the (lack of) parking guidelines."
"Arrived with 10%. Trundling along at 75-88kw. I’m the only one here early in the morning.

I have not scrolled through the other reviews so sorry if this has already been mentioned.  The lines are painted wrong. If you park per them the SC is directly behind you instead of the left corner. Again I’m the only one here so I split the difference to line up correctly.

Photo attached.

Therefore the poor rating.  I’ve never been here when it’s busy.  I wonder if the misaligned spots cause a problem. I run a bike carrier so it’s crucial that the spots are lined correctly so that I can back up very close to the SC to reach the port.

Otherwise nicely located fairly close to freeway and far enough from the entrances to discourage ICEing."
"As a local Emeryville resident, charging here was AMAZING before the Bay became over saturated with Teslas. I only charge during off peak hours, usually a rate of $.23 kWh but has been $.45 - $.48 kWh for at least a month now!! Heads up, Tesla informed me that the Emeryville locations DOES NOT OFFER OFF PEAK HOURS/RATES anymore!! It was good before it lasted, I guess no more super early morning/late night charging sessions for me, for now."
"As a local.. This is great.. Otherwise had to travel to Tinton falls or Barnegat and each was a 40 mile round trip.. Usually empty from other tesla users.. However one downside.. The tesla charging spots are shared with non tesla vehicles. But there's a sign of 15 min general use.. Some follow some don't. As of now, have always been able to find a spot though"
"As a Marriott Platinum member, I appreciate when they have charging available on site. This location is great for activities in the area"
"As a supercharger customer I expect supercharger speeds. What they won’t tell you is if you have more than two cars charging, they throttle the speed at least twice so I’m getting in the 57-58 kw range. Why can’t this be communicated upfront so we can plan? Very disappointing."
As advertised! Ran perfectly...Easy access and exit... expected station amenities were there (bathroom was clean)...nice team member...
"As always Tesla superchargers are placed conveniently across the country to help us continue to navigate in electric automobile and cut down CO2 Emissions. Clean location, near by food access"
"As always, fast, easy and reliable!"
"As another reviewer has stated, after 6 months of it sitting completed it was finally activated, on 10/13/22. Great location off of RT 287, 22 and 28. Also EA chargers at the Target down the road."
As expected.  Up to 155kw for me.
As far as I can tell it's only 150 kW (not 250 kW). When I was charging there as the only vehicle the maximum rate I received was 60 kW..
"As long as food keep in mind that only if you leave one stall open in between cars (to get 50kw) it's pleasant.
If it gets down to 13kw, it become clear that we're far from a capacity to ""only"" double the amount of electric cars on the road."
"As mentioned it is a sema charger, so needed my adapter.  Charging was at about 20 mi/hr, but was fine as I had my model S charging all day... 6.5 hrs to fully charge.  Spaces are a bit tight for model S, sure fine for model 3.  First two hours free."
"As noted, this one's a little bit south of Rte. #1 in the parking lot between Ashley Homestore and Dollarama. You must pass it and make the left hand U-turn to get back to the chargers. (You may not see them from the road down from Rte #1 as the lot is in a valley.) Only five units but they all worked and no waiting."
"As of 12May2022 charger 2D is not working. Other than that, this is a very good Supercharger location with food, bathrooms, coffee, and free air for tires. 250Kw. The rest of the chargers appear to be working very well."
"As of 9-8-21.  These 4 stalls are currently OUT OF SERVICE  and stall 4D and to the right of 4D is working but everything else is great quick charge get here early morning chargers fill
Up fast"
"As of 9/25/22 this Supercharger has problems. Chargers 1 A/B delivers no power, and 3 A/B only deliver about 7kW.  Chargers 2 & 4 working properly."
"As of January 2023, there are 12 chargers at 250kw. You can show your key fob for a 10% discount at foothills bowl. Sufficient light at night."
"As of right now, not a lot of people are charging here. (That's a really good thing)

I'm sure I'll edit this in the future as more and more EV owners learn about this new hotspot. 😊"
"As of September 2020, Charging a Tesla on HHI is next to impossible. This charging station maxed out at a charge of 23 miles per hour.  It also has a sign that it is restricted to only cars with a marina permit."
As of today 4 have not been turned on yet.  Watch for the unlit Tesla logo to help figure out which aren't active yet.
"As of today,  August 1, 2022, this Supercharger location is still not open. There are now a total of 16 charging stations but none of them are active. It sure would be nice for Tesla to post either here or online the status of the chargers."
"As of today, 11/30/22 someone has cut all of the chargers except for one!"
As other commentors have said 6 of the spots were taken by other cars leaving only 2 spots for electric cars. By the end of the charge only one car left. Otherwise nice clean gas station with a Subway and Godfathers pizza
"As others have mentioned, there is a dog park in the same shopping center which helped our dog burn off some energy during our road-trip."
"As others have said, located in the front right corner of the Harris Teeter parking lot.  Minor issue and it may be something I did wrong, but I only got 95-97 kW charging speed vs the max 150 kW speed of this version of Superchargers.  Also, the supercharger charging cord is very short or at least shorter then other Superchargers I’ve stopped at.  I had to back in very deep to make sure the cord would reach.  I know, minor issues.  I’m just glad there is a Supercharger in the Outer Banks to use and charge up my car while visiting….PS and FYI….there is a group of 5 chargers in one section and then another group of 3 chargers separated by a small bump out of grass…."
"As others have stated at the time of this post the Exxon is still under construction. Which is disappointing because I’ll have to find another bathroom. Giving it 5 stars anyway because it’s 250kW and it’s at a (future) gas station.

Not a fan of chargers at venues like the one in Tulsa Oklahoma. Yeah it had a bathroom but it was far away from the chargers in the casino.

Having these chargers at convenience stores makes so much more sense."
"As previously mentioned this charger is at the BP gas station across from the Taco Bell and the McDonald's.

Clean area and gas station had clean bathrooms."
"As previously mentioned, this is located in the Belmond Charleston Hotel valet area. There are only 2 Tesla chargers, one was out of order, and the other was being used. We ended up using the chargepoint charger there, which was also complimentary, and gave us a 35 mi/hr charge, which was helpful considering there are limited charging options in the city. The valet staff was really accommodating and just let us pull our car in after moving the barrier for us."
"As someone stated 9 months ago, one of the Tesla chargers is not working ( one on the left if facing bldg) 10kw. There are also two Enviro Spark chargers."
"As the main photo shows, this location is often block with vehicles towing trailers and delivery trucks. Very busy at times. Near Wawa and McDonald's. Be prepared to wait if you arrive between sunrise and 8 am as this is usually when supply trucks arrive for Wawa."
"As the only supercharger between Superior and Butte it is unfortunate that Tesla has not upgraded this Supercharger to a v3.  Other than that it has been very reliable. It is right next to a hotel, gas station, Starbucks, and a pizza restaurant."
"As usual at Sheetz in PA several chargers ICEd. Sheetz locations do not care.

Please, Tesla, don't use Sheetz for SC."
"As you drive into this area where the superchargers are, the ones on your left don’t seem to be working properly. It’s best to pay attention to your screen and see if the charging is stable or fluctuating."
"At  a SheetZ at busy intersection with 2 strip malls across the street. Includes: Chick filA, McDonald's, Firehouse subs, Pizza hut for eating options and Kroger's too. Sun trust and BB&T bank."
"At 11 pm three others charging. Excellent location in Eastview Mall.

Mid level management of Tesla must be the other side of worthless. Lousy communication. Lousy decision making. One bank of chargers in all of the Rochester region. Amazing with not even chargers at their service center.

This one is decent with a charge of ~500 miles per hour.
Why aren’t there more Teslas in Rochester. Duh: no chargers. Lousy service."
"At 3 in the morning no competition for charging, but no amenities either. On a warm, foggy night the place has an almost eerie quality.  Does offer a quiet place to take a nap, though."
At a gas station convenience store. Has more than 4 chargers. Good enough
"At a Sheetz location, seems like a safe area, out in the open.  No issues with the chargers themselves. Thanks Telsa for the excellent supercharging network!"
"At a Sheetz station, so bathrooms, food, drinks, etc are convenient. There are also trash cans."
At a WaWa but nothing else within walking distance.
"At a Wawa, so there is food to order.  I was the only one charging for the :45 minutes I was there, last night.  Katerina, who rung up the few time I went into Wawa, she was super friendly.  They have nugget ice."
At candlewood suites.  Worked great!
"At Kiwanis Park, in the back, before the tennis courts. Free charger. Need adapter. 32A"
At Sheetz. Never too busy.  In the back but feels well lit and safe
At the Flying J. Food bathrooms and dog area
"At the Sheetz gas station; one block off I-90, across from the Presque Isle casino.
For food, there’s “Lucky Louie’s Bar and Grill” on the next block (which we didn’t try— had lunch already). Or you can get snacks at the Sheetz. If you want to stop for lunch with more choices, try the Supercharger at the next exit west."
At the Wawa - left side of the gas tank area at the edge of the property.  Good availability and room to back in to your space.
At this time only one charger works and it’s always a gamble for a spot due to ICE vehicles parking there.
At WaWa charging stations you can get one of the best sandwiches in the USA!
Ate good veggie burger and veggie wrap at Frog’s here—would return. Used mall bathrooms earlier—also bathrooms in food court. No grocery in this mall area.
"Attempted to charge when it was -15°F, superchargers reported errors until temp warmed up."
"Attempted to use 11/19/2019. I tried three chargers, the first two just did not charge. The port would go from blue to not lit. The third went from blue to red, stall out of service. What a waste to expect a top up while I go into the store, get a coffee, just to find out no charge.. I was able to drive up to napa and get a full charge 10 minutes later at another supercharger station so I'm positive it wasnt the car."
"Aug 22 Update- stopped by to charge my Tesla again and everything went smoothly as always.

Charged here on the way back from Bodega Bay. Got over 400 charging speed. There are decent stores nearby like Target, TJ Max, etc."
Austin needs more superchargers. Best one is at South Park Meadows I35 and Slaughter area in strip mall.
"Availability of a convenience store close by. Even though chargers were busy and 80% charge limited still was getting a fast steady charge rate.

Occupant next to me, warned me the station I was in wasn't working last week, but it charged perfectly.

Free air was next to charging station (supplied by convenience station) but couldn't get air pressure to go past 35psi)."
"Average charging rate, with an unremarkable adjacent retail outlet."
"Average speed for a charge, not slow and not super fast. The gas station has a make your own coffee station, slushy, and soda bar. Lots of nick-nack things and snacks. Large and clean bathrooms. There's a bunch of options for coffee and food on this exit, too."
Averaged at 70 kw. Slow
averaging about 50kw.  second time to this location.  fresh coffee and a restroom.  not a lot of close alternatives if you’re driving through wyoming.
Avoid if possible.  The stalls are shared across 4 stalls.  With only three filled I only got 25k/hr.
"Avoid the supercharger in St. Johnsbury VT. It's at a failed JC Penney's mall. No place to eat. If you can find an unlocked door to the mall hallway maybe there's an open bathroom. Lincoln NH, South Burlington VT, and West Lebanon, NH all better. Of course if you're stuck, it works fine, though not the fastest. But, in the future I'm going to plan such that I don't have to stop there."
"Avoid this charger, would try one off Hamilton Place, this one located in paid air port lot, no close facilities. Also off highway good 3-4 miles, 10 miles away from Chattanooga which is far as well. Tesla needs to upgrade charging options in Chattanooga immediately."
Aways available and good charging speeds. Trash can and places to go within walking distance.  Great stop.
Awesome 16 stalls at Buc ee’s!!  Super busy Sunday afternoon but well organized and can look worse than it is getting in and out. Best bathrooms on the road anywhere.
"Awesome charge, cleanest electicity in tha D. Would highly recommend 10/10"
"Awesome charging rate as we added50% in about 20 minutes.
Drawback is the location in the parking lot, just next to the drivethrough lane, where folks aren't really respectful and ICE the charging spots."
Awesome charging spot. Plenty of chargers and they have a special side entrance for Tesla owners to enter the casino where there is a nice little coffee shop in the lobby and clean bathrooms.
Awesome charging station Home 2 Suites and Springhill Suites within a 30 second walking distance. Great food places and shopping.
Awesome charging station. Not busy or crowded and there's plenty of places to go to (shop or eat) while charging. It's the one closest to home so we prefer this location. I also like that I can just walk around (when it's not too hot) and get my steps in for the day. Highly recommended.
Awesome hotel and friendly staff. I stayed here specifically because they allow doggos and the destination charger allowed me to stay here and commute to my warehouse while traveling. Just call ahead and they'll put out cones so you dont get ICED.
Awesome location to get your Tesla charged.. depending how long you plan to stay.  It's free! Helps with bumping up driving range if dealing with RANGE ANXIETY till get to a Tesla Super Charger. Which is what I NEEDED. 2 charging ports 1) 29A at about a rate of 24 MPH. And the other is 32A at about 30 MPH.
Awesome location with a supermarket nearby to refill with your favorite snacks and drinks.
"Awesome location with tons of things within walking distance. There's plenty of food and drink options and enough open into the evening for washrooms too. After 9 it becomes more complicated, and I'd love to see windshield cleaning supplies nearby, but this is still a great charging spot.

250kW super reliable charging as usual, and near enough to the highway too for those passing through on a road trip."
"Awesome location! Easy to get to from the freeway, spacious & clean parking lot, plenty of amenities. The Petro station is large and clean with friendly staff. 10 back-in type stalls, half are 30min general parking and half are Tesla-only."
Awesome location. Lots of restaurants and shops nearby. Favorite is Donut Refinery. Overall very convenient
"Awesome location. Small shops and food options right near charger. Sonic in same parking lot has a dog park and bathrooms! Only negative is there are 8 chargers supplied by 2 (1A-D, 2A-D) resulting in slow charging speeds"
Awesome network of charging
"Awesome new supercharger with 8 stalls and 250kW charging!!
Great location just south of Newark for UD visitors... And not too far from another supercharger!!
This is at a Royal Farms, so if it could get really busy and non-teslas may park in the charging spots... Oh well!!
Happy charging!!"
Awesome place to charge and perfect stop on our road trip!
Awesome place to get some Tillamook ice cream while charging. Has 4x J1772 chargers.
Awesome place to have a supercharger!  Outback steakhouse and I think a Mexican restaurant very close by for food and restrooms.  Nice place to take a walk too with amazing views.
"Awesome Smithfield's amenities, convenient location, good parking. Was a great spot."
Awesome speed!!! I would give another star if the station was on a level surface and perhaps covered. Woo Hoo! True Supercharging! (unlike many others) I just needed enough to get 40 miles to home. But I was well under 20% charge so I added about 100 miles in about 5 minutes for $10.08. At one point the car said it was charging at over 1200 miles per hour. Would have been about 23 minutes to 80% I think. Quick turnover on charging spots. While some amenities are available there isn't much need for them when I can get the charge I need so quickly. Very happy to stop at this station.
Awesome spot :-) Giant rest area with a bunch of food choices....fast charging speed.
"Awesome spot with lots of dining options within close range. Thankful to have this is Corpus for trips between San Antonio, Corpus, Rockport. 250 kW for super fast charging!"
Awesome stop! There's not only provisions but a trash receptacle with windshield washers/squeegee! Great for those long summer trips where bugs outnumber cars! 😉
Awesome super charge station!!! WaWa is in the same parking lot. Super fast clean safe.
Awesome supercharger conveniently placed near some fast food spots and a gas station/convenience store with plenty of snacks/drinks to choose from! Plugged the car to top it off on the way to Prescott and it wasn't busy at all. Def recommend this place for charging!
Awesome supercharger with picnic tables and swing set. I highly recommend to grab some burgers to go from the Murdo's Drive-In first and enjoy a picnic while you charge (they don't have a drive through but were pretty quick).
"Awesome supercharger, best I've used so far. There's a little park area for kids to play on and tons of shops and restaurants all around. The family loved it.

FYI, 40 min max, because the place gets a lot of traffic."
Awesome superchargers highly recommended to supercharge with plenty of convenience stores near by.
"Awesome Tesla Supercharger location. Rated for 150 KW per hour. Outlet mall with many popular stores is about 250’ away. BJ’s Restaurant, OnCue gas station & convenience store and many other food choices within a reasonable walking distance."
Awesome that there are free Tesla chargers open to the public. I only took a star off because the charging current was unstable (bouncing between 28 A and 48 A) and because there's nothing like a coffee shop around to get some work done while you wait.
Awesome Wawa and a great place to charge. Solid 250kw V3 charger. Excellent and easy to get to location thats clean.
Awesome!
"Awesome! Brand new location and 12 V3 superchargers, which means charging speeds up to 1000 miles/hour! Remember, your batteries have to be preheated and it will only hit those speeds for the first 17-20% battery charge level. After that it starts to taper down.
See pic for nearby food."
Awesome! Full set of 11 regular back-in chargers + 1 pull-in I used because of bike rack! Two Chargepoint stations as well. Target across the lot for amenities.
Awesome! Super fast electrons and a Hy-Vee nearby.
"Awkward location, far from the highway. Unless you are staying up there, better to charge before heading up the pass."
Back open. Great location with bathrooms and restaurants
"Backed-up to a charger that was out commission, otherwise clean nicely located off the freeway. Many stores in the parking lot, to access while waiting for the charging."
"Bad charger, 9miles/hour"
Bad charging destination. We checked into the hotel with the thought of having destination charging. It doesnt work. Woman at the front desk put a big smile and said all 3 chargers are out of order. Do not stop here and do not rely on this charger.
"Barely arrived with 3% only to find construction going around, despite the Tesla map showing it to be available. Cannot access any station.

If you're passing through Custer, you can find level two Tesla charge points in the area. Just keep that in mind if you're passing through expecting to charge up here"
"Basic supercharging station next to a Meijer grocery store. They have nice, clean washrooms. There's a Starbucks very close by. You will also pass by tons of fast food restaurants that you can visit either before or after your charging session. It's about 7 miles north of the I-90 freeway, though. No issues with the charging speed!"
"Bathrooms - Clean. Foods - It's Sheetz, so solid. Perfect location. Right off the highway, right in front of the store. Easy access. Trash cans right near the chargers!!! 👍👍👍"
Bathrooms are so gross and the area around the chargers is full of trash. Wish they would clean it up.
"Bathrooms near by are not well kept. So bring some baby wipes.
Also the connector near the handicap stall and the handicap stall are beat up pretty bad. They look like they have laid on the ground for more time than they should.

I decided not to use this station and travel down the road about 4 minutes to the train depot location. Much nicer and the bathrooms are great. Lots of tourists and murals to take pictures and stuff."
battery gate limited charge speeds on all stalls
Battery powered cars have poisonous batteries that are not bio degradable and a disaster for the landscape and environment.
"Be advised this is in a paid parking lot. Unless, you go to Mom’s organic supermarket and spend $8, you get 2 free hours of parking. Out of the 2 supercharging options in Philly centre city area right now (8/19), this is the better option during daylight hours. A little hard to find as the Tesla sign is very small to spot. Only reason this gets a 3⭐️ because of the Mom’s organic supermarket. Otherwise, I feel like Tesla could do better than this"
Be aware that this is within the Townsend Hotel and you have to pay a 10$ valet parking fee.
"Be careful,  some is always parking and ICE in these spots.  But on the positive side you don't have to stay at the hotel to use the charger"
Beautiful and well spaced Tesla Charging station. There is also a well designed Gas station just beside it in case you are travelling within a group and everyone needs to re-fuel. The only downside is that there is nothing except for a Casino close by.
"Beautiful decor and lighting at Supercharger and on adjacent Holiday Express, which shares the access road. Charge rate is the fatest available (in 2021) -- 250 kW. (My 2020 Model S can only take 170 kW which is faster than the ubiqutous 150 kW Superchargers. However, all these charge rates are fantastic. C-C's Cafe is 1 short block North, and Subway is 5 blocks, approximately, South, toward city center. Open space and County Fairgrounds to North for run or stretch. Everything so close together and to Interstate 94."
Beautiful location. There's a beautiful garden and a historic jail in the lot. No restrooms/or at least were visible easily.
"Beautiful park with walking trails. Bathrooms nearby at the playground. No food or anything nearby, but a nice place to stop for a picnic while your car is charging."
Beautiful rainbow! No restroom nearby though.
Beautiful setting for a supercharger at the Marriott with a pretty rose garden out front where you can walk your dogs. Recommend charger 5B across the way because 5A is only for wheelchair accessible parking.
"Beautiful setting, 4 Tesla chargers, easily visible in the valet parking lot. Excellent food available in lodge."
Beautiful station. Open 24/7. Plenty of spots (always check before coming). 10/10!
Beautiful. Pizza available at 5pm. Nice picnic tables.
"Because it's there, not crowded today.  Shopping near by."
"Been broken for months, nobody knows when they'll be fixed"
"Been here several times last few years and never full, never had issues with Loves, subway or McDonald’s. Perfect spot to take a break if you are driving to and fro from Corpus Christi."
Been though here a few times.  Safe site.  Walking distance to local restaurants.
"Been visiting family in Northern CA once a month for a year.  Have learned a few Supercharger locations along the route from Las Vegas to Bay Area.  This is located on Perimeter Road in a Manteca shopping center on Hey 120, after turning off CA Hwy 99.  Lots of area to walk, restaurants available, stores open too.  I go to Bass Pro Shop for rest room and to check their clearance racks.  Easy back on Hwy 120 towards 580 and Bay Area.  Would recommend as a location to charge."
"Before coming you should know that the first 15 mins is free, then $7 per hour for parking. I charged for 30 mins for less than $7-8 on the supercharger and the freaking parking charged me $7. If you want to save on the $7, go out at 15 mins and make a loop and come back in. Annoying but what can you do?!"
"Behind a few fast food restaurants ie; Zaxbys, Burger King and Taco Bell. There's a gas station and Waffle House with a short walk. I've been here a few times and it's  usually busy but I've been lucky and haven't had to wait for a charging spot."
Behind Buc-ees in Wharton.  Lots of food choices and clean restrooms.
"Behind Chuy's restaurant, a little hard to find with all the construction."
Behind DQ. Alongside Goodwill.
Behind hotel. No place to eat. Terrible getting out of.  Worst Super Charger we have gone to since buying the car in 2017.  Try to avoid this one unless staying at the hotel
Behind Market Basket. 12 V3 superchargers
"Behind Shell, off of I80 in Girard. Eight charging stations, all were empty when I arrived. The station I was charging at showed it would charge from 90 miles to 275 miles in 35 min."
Behind the Collin Street Bakery. Had to wait approximately 15 minutes for a charger to open. 1/2 the cars did not have people in them. It always makes you wonder how long and how many of those cars are fully charged but just idling. Yeah idling fees don’t help me get on the road though. Charged up to 80% and continued on my trip from DFW area to Houston round trip. Y’all be Safe out there.
Behind the Culver's. No trash bins or Air.
"behind the Grand Idaho Inn & Suites. charger worked. hotel smells like a swimming pool, bathrooms are not in the best shape. out of order signs."
Behind the Holiday Inn Express again. Walking distance to food. The staff in the HI Express are very accommodating.
Behind the outlets but we were there at 8 pm. No issues charging and felt safe. Good place asking the Oregon coast. They are the shared kind so if full you can't get full charge.
Behind WAWA. Fast and convenient.
"Behind Woody's smokehouse in the corner of the parking lot. Just in case a semi is blocking the view.
We went over to the chevron which wa open late at night."
Beside a lovely little grocery store with great delight sandwiches and  cappuccinos.
Besides MacDonald: There is a soft serve ice cream stand right behind sheetz with outdoor tables and grass patch for your dog. Just what the Tesla Gods recommend this summer.
"Best charging station EVER!  I wish Tesla service stations in southern Cal offered this service.  Nice lobby area while you charge. Clean Bathrooms. Free latte’s and tea. Free bottled water. And wifi access.
Thank you Tesla!  You’re my jam girl!"
Best charging station in Farmville.
"Best kept secret for now.  This charger is new so not many knows about it, yet.  As a result,  there is always a charger available when I visit.  Great location too."
Best location in White County for EV charging. I will definitely come back in the day time to enjoy wine while charging. Only took one star because at night it’s pretty dark. A few lights for safety would be great.
"Best one yet! Sheetz right there with clean bathrooms, food, free tire air, and a car wash. Lots of stalls, and we were the only ones there midday Saturday."
"Best option for supercharging in the city but you need to pay for parking in order to charge. But the way to get around that would be to make an   $8 or more purchase from the MOMs Organic Market above the garage, get your ticket validated for 2hrs of free parking and your supercharge session will be ""free"". Only gripe was that there were 2 non Tesla’s parked in the Tesla spot for what looked like a prolonged period of time so the 7 Tesla spots were actually 5 available spots and I would never of known that from the Tesla navigation system that tells me how many spots are open."
"Best place to charge Tesla during St Patrick’s parade :-). It is right at the end of the parade route, kids enjoyed 1st row experience and we could get out without waiting for roads to reopen. Tesla was full and happy too."
Best place to charge your Tesla. Can’t beat that for $3 parking. Everywhere else charges ridiculous parking fees. Make sure you enter where you see the red Tesla Charging Station sign the proceed to level G. It is the second to last level.
Best price for supercharger in this area. Can’t beat that.
"Best supercharger ever! It’s at a WaWa! And, walk across the street to have a sit down meal at Cinco de Mayo. Great guacamole. Great service!"
"Best supercharger I've ever been to and the fastest I've ever used (well over 100 kW).  Incredibly clean bathrooms at the Busy Bee, great food selection including Burger King, Dunkin Donuts, jerky counter, fresh baked goods, froyo, etc.. Tons of cute home goods, toys, souvenirs, tchotchkes, etc.  Dog-friendly with fresh water out front.  I thought the bee puns were hilarious but that's subjective.

UPDATE 2020: I've been to at least 15 superchargers across the southeast now and this is still my favorite Supercharger, hands down, no contest."
"Best supercharger location I've visited.  The location is ideal, it is at a large truck stop right off the interstate with a Burger King, Dunkin' Donuts, and a great convenience store.  The supercharger are in a corner of the parking lot and easy to get into.  The restrooms at the Busy Bee are great, clean, roomy, and very high quality build.  This was our favorite supercharger location by far."
"Best Supercharger location to charge before heading east into the mountains. A clean bathroom is available at the gas station next door. On a busy day, you could drop off family at Ikeda's on the other side of I-80, go charge up, and by the time you're back to Ikeda's you can have lunch or dinner together."
Best supercharger next to a super restaurant. We were on our way down from Philly.  17% to full while we had a great dinner.
Best Supercharger stop I have been to yet! 48 stalls at 250kw is awesome and at a Bucees to make it even better.
Best Tesla super charger to get stores near by. Nice gas station with subway and other hot food.
"Best Tesla Supercharger in Bismarck. 😁

Lots of restaurants and stores nearby.

Not a great location late at night as restaurants and other businesses would be closed.

Nearest hotels are on the other side of the Interstate."
Best Western
"Best Western Plus Hotel . For tesla use only ,  exclusive for hotel guest , 2 spot only . 23miles per hour for model 3 , need front desk permissions to charge ."
"Beware, Tesla is defrauding you to inflate their revenues through their tesla insurance system, using fraudulent forward collision warning’s to raise your rate"
"Beware, Tesla is defrauding you to inflate their revenues through their tesla insurance system, using fraudulent forward collision warning’s to raise your rate"
Big charging area in the HyVee parking lot
"Bit expensive charge rate and not many available spots. The Last spot on the end is extremely tight too, as are all the other spaces as well."
Bit hard to find as it is in a garage.
"Bit of a slower supercharger, the proximity to the Quicktrip gas station is the best part."
Bit of a walk to the Buc-ee’s through the parking lot so be mindful of traffic. Nice green space behind the chargers to let your pet stretch their legs.
"Blessings to Mr Elon musk  for this  car, best i had ever driven. Good  Technology.  Please to install a  solar panel on the Roof, so that i don't have to stop and charge.  It's A  little inconvenience."
Blocked by ICE cars
"Blocked by ICE vehicles. Powered down. Valets say they are broken but really they are just slow, 200v 15a. Not worth the trouble."
"Bolingbrook now has V3 supercharging! The original 8, on the left, are v2 but the 8 new additions, on the right, are v3. V3 supercharging can charge at speeds up to 1000 miles/hour!  Keep in mind that these speeds are only available when the batteries are very low (0-15%) and then starts to taper down after that.
Only 4 stars because I think they are charging more money for v3, but I haven't confirmed this yet."
Both a charging station and a handicap spot. The station was blocked by a regular ICE vehicle with a handicapped placard when we got there...... 👍
Both a Telsa charger and non-tesla charger here.
"Both are broken as of Sep 2, 2022"
Both chargers have equipment failure… so no way to charge at all here
Both chargers seem to be in good working order. Got 11kw while charging.
Both of the charging systems  do not work one is completely  destroyed. Not happy with this. At all
Both on site stations are broken. It looks like someone may have backed into The pole.
Both outlets are broken.   One has bare wires exposed near the charging handle.
Both Tesla (connector in rough shape) an J-1772 worked great in getting a quick charge while eating in town.
Both Tesla chargers are broken. One other EV charger functional @6KW.
Both Tesla chargers not functional. Chargepoint also apparently not functional.
Both Tesla charging stations at this location is broken
"Brand New ! 12 spots, 1 for Disabled. Fully operational, even though the Tesla Supercharger finder in the vehicle did not show it"
Brand new 250kW Supercharger right outside restaurants and within walking distance to the Walmart & Target.
"Brand new bank of 8 superchargers at this Casey's in Rochelle, IL. They are a couple of blocks north of the entrance/exit to I-88. One of the supercharger spots was specifically for EVs pulling in forward instead of reversing. It's great that the chargers are so close to the front door of Casey's. This is a small, compact gas station, but the restrooms were clean and they had fresh pizza ready as usual."
"Brand new super charger, VERY convenient to Springwoods.  These are tucked in behind the mall, specifically behind the Mod Pizza and Nashville Hot chicken place, but excellent ramen, coffee and hipster tacos are in easy walking distance.  There's even a nice shady sitting area next to Mod."
"Brand new Supercharger in Wells, NV. They were still putting down the paint lines but we were able to use the chargers with no problem.  It's located in the Petro Shopping Center/Gas Station with access to bathrooms and some restaurants"
Brand new Supercharger station! Looks great!Convenient distance from the highway and is tucked away behind the new Culver’s.
"Brand new supercharger with clean bathrooms and heat. You need the code from your Tesla navigation, when you select the charger on the map. The bathrooms are the temporary trailers for now, but they look to be building a full stop. The new building is up and looks like an oven is going in.

To access the chargers, you need to enter from Cal Club Rd, we almost missed the charger while driving to the 5.

Brand new V3 chargers - 250kw"
"Brand new V3 chargers, across the street from the restaurant. Great location, great restaurant!"
"Brand new, beautiful place. Grocery store and nearby restaurants"
"Brand New, just opened! Fast charge. One charger at the end is slightly blocked by an adjacent air pump spot."
"Brand new!  15 chargers on the top level of a parking garage.  Need to grab a ticket, but 30 mins is free for charging.  In one of the best neighborhoods in ATL.  An abundance of amazing restaurants and several nice hotels within a short walk."
Brand New. Easy access from the highway. Nice marketplace to grab a few things while you charge.
Brand New/Opened 4 Weeks Ago! Plenty of Slots & Plenty of Space from the Gas Station! (Co-located in the Wawa Gas Station)
"Brandon Dunes is amazing! Lodging, food, walking, beaches, and golf. All 5 stars"
Breakers were off and it was not working business was closed they need to remove themselves from being a Tesla destination charge station
Brendon is/was amazing. This was a great wedding!
"Brilliant location for a supercharger. Right off I-70 yet very walkable town with restaurants and shops. If you just need a bathroom, the ones in the kum and go are okay.  I’ve yet to reach anything close to the advertised 250 kw but maybe that’s just because it’s winter..."
Brilliant. These spots are 20 steps from the outlet stores. Super clean and a great pastime for the 13 minutes it took to top off.
"Bring peak ""Tesla"" to the Outer Banks. As usual, these are all the way across the parking lot from the grocery store but there is kombucha..."
Bring your walking shoes as this Supercharger is a hike to restroom facilities and eating options. Stopped early morning before mall opened and glad to report that restrooms were available. At night (8:30 p.m.) there was security truck roving the parking lot.
Broke! Luckily the Clipper creek charger wasn't broke. But the tesla charger handled were busted.
Broken in May 2020 and still not repaired in November 2020.
Broken. They do not charge.
"Buc-cees mania...what more can I say? This was my first time experiencing the praline, bbq, beaver nugget hysteria. Just be sure you're prepared for the submersion of full fledged Buc-cee's experience after sitting in a car for hours in solitude."
"Buc-cees mania...what more can I say? This was my first time experiencing the praline, bbq, beaver nugget hysteria. Just be sure you're prepared for the submersion of full fledged Buc-cee's experience after sitting in a car for hours in solitude."
"Buc-ee’s Tesla Superchargers are convenient to the interstate, numerous, and fast. We were able to pull in and charge without dropping our trailer, but is the chargers are busy there is room to drop your trailer. Great place to get a snack while charging."
Bucees superchargers are the best!  No better way to spend 30 minutes than visiting a Bucees!
Burger place right north of the charger.   Parking lot was free to enter.   Lots of homeless.  Be careful at night
Busier than usual. Probably because there are a lot more Teslas on the road than previous times I've been there.
"Busiest supercharger I've used, only 2 spaces open when I arrived at 1 on a Sunday afternoon. Decent location, easy to find."
Busted and out of order
Busy area. Gets full pretty quickly as this is a mall area. We’ve used this location twice. Nice encounter both times.
"Busy at times, dead at others! We visited the Poconos to do some skiing and used the chargers at Tannersville several times. The first time we used it, there was only one stall vacant. And several Teslas were circling, waiting for an opening. However, the other times we charged, there was plenty of space. We never charged past 8 so we didn't have to deal with security.
Located right behind Brooks Brothers but you need to circle all the way around the parking lot to get to it which is which is slightly annoying. However, there was plenty to do while charging since the outlets have over 100 stores."
"Busy but always a spot. Be careful though, these run high and charge fast so running for a bite to eat may result in idle fees. Set to 90%"
Busy but convenient.
"Busy but fast supercharger. Walk to coffee, Perkins, casino/Mexican joint."
Busy but location is near to Brane nobles where I went to coffee shop and read book for an hour. Great to pass an hour during charging.
Busy but we were able to get a spot without waiting. In hotel parking lot. Hotel had bathrooms we were able to use while charging. Didn't get food this stop but we saw McDonald's next door and a few other fast food spots nearby.
"Busy charger but got a spot 3pm on Sunday, next to Walmart and wawas so can’t complain"
"Busy charger, lots of people coming and going, but no one had to wait for a spot. Received good charge around 85kw. There are lots of places to grab food, but I do not eat in my car, and almost all of them were drive thru only, cook out, KFC, Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell, all have no dine in at this time. Ironically, Buffalo wild wings, and IHOP did, but we're so understaffed the wait was 20 minutes, just to sit. Both told us they only had one sever, so we ended up at Panera, right next to charger. They were busy, but finished at the same time the car did, so perfect."
"Busy charging spot.  Right next to a California Pizza Kitchen if you need a bite.  Otherwise, you can spend your charging time at the mall shopping."
"Busy is 3 of 6 occupied stations.  If a wait and food is necessary you are a block walk from burgers, chicken, pizza with no less than 5 fast-food options.  I prefer the fresh fruit at the local IGA grocery store."
Busy location but so is the one at the mall. Definitely need more chargers on the east side of Madison - only reason for 4 stars. Otherwise safe enough location with the grocery store right there.
"Busy on a Sunday afternoon but easy stop with 8 stalls and a McDonalds, farm market and bakery in the parking lot. Plenty of grassy areas for walking a dog."
"Busy on Saturday noon, therefore limited maximum charging speed. No trash cans nearby."
Busy shopping complex as expected on a Sunday afternoon. A bit of a detour from I-10. Much cheaper than most superchargers though. Just over 8 cents kwh. Worth it if you’re not in a hurry.
"Busy spot for charging your Tesla since it's the last official Tesla charger before heading into Bar Harbor.

The chargers are hidden towards the back of the store, on the right hand side.

Due to how popular this spot is, you can't charge past a certain limit."
"Busy, high usage, one station told me there was an error so I had to move.  Many stations, only maybe 3 or 4 free.  There is not enough east Orlando superchargers tbh,.so check availability before you head there."
"Busy, nice restrooms, dog area, good place to take a break between Phoenix and Las Vegas. Don't let your dog go into the retention pond. :)"
"Busy, not as fast as you would think when busy.

If there’s no one here when you come by, then yes you can get a great amount of power in a short amount of time - but it’s rare that there’s not much Tesla’s here.

You can go into the Rite Aid and mess around/buy something you don’t need while you charge but, like some kind of Schrödinger’s cat situation, you only realize how slow the charger is when you get out of the car.

Overall, it’s good, but also not as quick or convenient as you’d think."
Buy made in US buy Tesla.  Support freedom of speech !
Call the hotel before arriving to make sure space is available. There are two chargers. The space was close to the entrance of the hotel and was free the two nights I stayed. Be careful opening your trunk! The ceiling is low enough to hit.
"Called in, asked if I could use their station if available, front desk assured no guest were using it. Thanks Best Western!
2 Tesla Stations pulling 48amps/ 36mph."
Came here on a Saturday morning (7:45 am) in June. Located in HyVee parking lot. Charging was quick and simple (24 min for 47% charge on my Y). Easy access from highway. $.41/keh at the time of the charge (2022).
"Came here on a weekday morning and almost all the slots were open. Wanted to charge from 45% to 100% for a road trip, and was ready to go in less than an hour. Whole Foods has a validation device at their entrance/exit that you can just scan your parking ticket at (for up to 2hr free). I needed to get something anyway but no whole food receipt was required I think."
Came last week late at night and it was good and bathrooms were open and plenty of parking for a nap if needed. Bathrooms open late was a highlight compared to a lot of other super charger locations. Gas stations and Burger King near by. Bathrooms out of order on 28Dec2022.
Came on 4/30/22 and the charging station is gone.
"Came there to use restroom inside Meijer after a long drive. They’re closed. Had to walk all the way to figure this out, employees had no clue. Felt a bit unsafe during the night. Charged a few miles and ran away to my hotel, and charged back in the morning."
Came to this location to charge my girlfriends toys. Great exp . Had her back in biz in half the time. Thanks Tesla !!!
can charge all that matters
Can easily walk to Sweet Santa Fe bakery for sweets and coffee.
Can't understand yet... cross country tríp and iver 10 Tesla Superchargers and maybe 2 had trash cans...
Cannot even get close to the charging station for all the vehicles parked in the way. Don't understand why this hotel would have such a feature and not support it
"Cannot find it at night.  Only way to get there is enter thru a ramp on ANza street,  not Geary"
"Cannot get any better than Buc-ee’s! Love this place and only 8/12 stalls are currently up and running. So nice and clean, it is behind the place itself away from the traffic."
Cannot see from street as you approach so just go to the Sheetz and look to the north west.
"Careful Tesla people, during the weekends at night, there's no enforcement against ICE-ing. Two cars were parked there despite plenty of parking outside. Glad this spot came online though."
Cars are blocking the chargers and can’t access them.
Casa de Fruit restaurants and Chevron gas station are near by.
"Casey's is always open, clean restrooms, nice staff. Charger is fast and not too busy."
"Caution: Many screws and nails found directly in front of charging stalls!

*Back after 8 months, looks like they cleaned the area up. No longer see screws and pallets everywhere."
Caution: this supercharger has a number of stalls that are general purpose parking overnight. Also kind of a slow mix.
Cell service is really bad at this location so sitting in your car to read emails or watch videos and such on your phone or cars media is not an option as it buffers the entire time. Also there’s nothing around to occupy time that’s worthy of your time. The casino is smokey and dirty and there’s nothing in walking distance such as a target or grocery store to grab something quick and get back on the road. Also not the best neighborhood with a lot of transient foot traffic
Charge for free for up to 2 hours just by spending $8 at Mom's Organic Market vegan for life.
Charge point charger 6kwh
Charge rate was 35 mi/hr for my model 3.  Stopped to top off before heading down to El Paso Supercharger location.   Las Cruces desperately needs a Tesla Supercharger!!!
"Charge rate was 39 miles per hour on my Model Y. 2 spaces, only 1 charger. Free for guests, including at restaurant."
Charge to 30 minutes go eat maybe go to the bathroom you're done and you're on your way back onto the highway it plans all your charging for you your battery time everything you think that you need to worry about you don't the Tesla will figure out for you and a superchargers are always usually clean and easy to park too but if you see a gas car there call to a company and most state laws statues will require them to be towed out of there because they're not electric
Charge your Tesla here!
Charge your Tesla here!
Charge!
Charge! I love Tesla.
charged all night and only half full.
"Charged around noon on a Friday, only one other Tesla there. Charged at 400+ miles for the first 100 miles. Not great but acceptable"
Charged at 12A. Ridiculous
"Charged at 135kw while 10 of 12 were in use! Shares parking lot with Lowe's, Carl's Jr, and Craker Barrel. WellsFargo nearby and Firehouse Subs across street! Shaded parking stalls would take this review to six stars🌟 get us out of the blazing desert sun☀️.
**Remember people your charging rate or kw will ramp up between 5% and 50% but will slow as the state of charge gets closer to 100%. Remember to add supercharger to your route to warm up the battery and get closer to that peak 250kw charging rate.👌"
Charged at 85kW. Only two stations available and it does not appear in the Tesla Navigation.
Charged at a decent speed. Quite a few things to do in the area while you wait.
"Charged at full speed.  Rarely more than one car there.  Great location by Manny's Restaurant, Home Depot, Walmart, and a couple other nice places to eat."
"Charged at the Baxter, MN supercharger. Easy enough to find and a great location between Minneapolis/Clearwater and Fargo."
"Charged fast. Unfortunately its quite a distance from the interstate but at least there is a HyVee with bathrooms, Starbucks and anything you could ever want for groceries. I was there late night so Starbucks was already closed but grocery store is open 24 hours."
Charged for about 30 minutes at #2B on 12/31/2021 with no issues. Just pick up your food before you stop. Trash cans up by the mall entrance.
"Charged here a few times in different stalls with a Y and 3. No issues, always at least 3 stalls open, and able to charge to 100%."
"Charged here in the late afternoon/early evening on a holiday so the burger cart and winery were closed. No available restrooms or snacking opportunities nearby. Parking lot was tight and didn't have room for potential overflow.

There were grassy areas around the chargers so it was easy to take the dogs for a quick walk and stretch. The views were beautiful!"
Charged here twice and had very good experiences both times. Restaurant is good about just using the restroom too.
Charged here twice today. Both times under 100kw and both preconditioned. Was hoping for Gen3 speed. Listed as a 250kw site. Otherwise not too busy and a Casey’s to stop in.
Charged here twice while staying at the host hotel.
Charged here twice. Slower charging at 120 kW. Located at sheetz. Bathrooms are decently clean and pretty typical for a Sheetz.  I didn't feel unsafe here.
Charged my 97 jeep wrangler in the 8 minutes I was buying booze. Highly recommend.  Lol
Charged my mach e here. 4 tesla chargers and 4 J1772 chargers. On ground level of parking garage. Free. My mach e got 34 miles of range in an hour and a half.
"Charged my Mach e using the Tesla Tap add-on. Worked great!  Thanks, Tesla."
"Charged pretty quick, 25 and done. Didn't have to wait for a spot, we just rolled right in. Just remember that the more people there charging, the longer it is going to take to top it off."
"Charged the X here on a Thursday morning about 9am. Located to the side of Bass Pro Shops. Not busy in the parking lot, but there were 5 or 6 other Tesla's charging. Charge rate was good, lots of places to walk to, and the area seemed safe. Easy access to/ from highway 120."
Charged to park. Not free charging like others have mentioned. Need a code to use bathroom. Very clean bathroom once you get it but the lights did not work. Bring your phone for light!
Charged Tuesday.  Chargers in good shape.  A bit of a walk to the nearest restroom in the grocery store
Charged twice. No problems. Plenty of stations and all @70kw/hr average until .80 no problem. Places to shop while you wait. Better than the Vacaville outlets for distance from charge to shopping. 👍
Charged when it was -9F outside and there were 7 other Teslas charging. Still got 220kw. Left 20 mins later with 75% charge.
"Charged with no problem although it was very busy when I was there. Only reason I took off a star was for how dirty the area was around the chargers - litter and trash everywhere, even though there were multiple trash cans provided (which is very much appreciated at a supercharger location!). Otherwise no issues. Convenient location."
Charger 1A is not working. The rest are ok.
Charger 1B was only charging our 20% full battery at 71kw/hrs. We moved down to 3A which properly charged at 150kw. Only one other Tesla here.
Charger 2B and 2D does not work on 3.6.22
"Charger 4a has a bent pin, won’t plug in. Not sure how to report this.

Also Tesla navigation tells you to take exit 25, but it’s easier to just drive into the Rest Area - the chargers (and ChargePoint units) are on the right before the rest stop building."
"Charger always works great and needed in this location, but amenities are severely lacking. No bathrooms, no coffee, nothing. There is also often garbage around. Probably blown in."
Charger at Best Western Plus. There is 1 J1772 charger and 2 wall socket outlets. Sign says hotel guests only
Charger charges well but the options for doing anything past 7 or 8 leave you to pretty much the bushes and water collection pond...
"Charger convenient in a needed location, but unfortunately the men’s restroom in this Royal Farms smelled awful and sink drain was clogged and sink almost overflowing. I did not feel comfortable buying any food since the workers had to be using the restroom also. One of the chargers has a bent pin, but no way to report it."
Charger didn’t charge.
Charger is at a sheets. New 250 charger. Also ice cream place and a McDonalds here also. Good speeds. Nice sheets. Only thing it that it was a bit off the high way. Prob about 7 mins off of route 79
"Charger is fine, area is sketchy. Don't go at night. I had someone try to sell me drugs at the kum and go. The gas station and both hotels had closed restrooms."
Charger is fine. Toilets are disgusting
Charger is for Stein Eriksen Lodge guests only. It's private property.
Charger is great. The people there all seem like the type of people who like Elon Musk too much. Keep your windows up and doors locked!
"Charger is in a Comfort Inn lot with no restroom. Closest gas stations are across a 4 lane highway or down a hill, and they aren’t great. Avoid if possible."
Charger is inoperable and left to rot in the back.
Charger is located outside garages in the building just west of the Sayer Hotel.
"Charger is not guaranteed to be turned on, even during business hours for paying customers. DO NOT depend on this charger to get you to your next destination."
Charger is still broken.
"charger is tacked on the front corner of the hotel building. valet had parked a non-EV car in the spot so i had to block the car in overnight to charge. had to leave key with the hotel concierge late at night. she did not know how to drive the car, so hoping the blocked car won’t leave until later the next morning. **UPDATE** picked up my car the next morning with no issues.  hotel staff were very kind about it, though not sure they had an official protocol for non-guests using the charger.  hoping newport will figure out some better charging options in the near future!"
Charger max 120kw but goes slower if more than your car there. Two sections though. There is 24 hour chevron across street for food or toilets.
Charger non working today 9/22/22. Tried to charge 2021 Model Y.
Charger not working
Charger not working.
Charger not working.
"Charger ok! Normally a line. 1D not operational.

Bathrooms inside of Royal Farms are a travesty. Go at your own risk."
"Charger was fast, easy to get to and located next to stores and restaurants."
Charger was good. Winn Dixie female bathroom was quite nasty.
"Charger was much slower than it should have been, and it's already a slower charger on a good day"
Charger was okay. Hated the hard rock music blaring over the speakers mounted on the adjacent light post. My least favorite supercharger location ever.
Charger was slow! Stayed there for an hour and a half and only got 4 miles out of the plug up! They need to make this a super changer or find out what is wrong with it! I thought these chargers were supposed to get you a full charge in 4 hours ???
"Charger worked as required, service station also there with plenty of food and drink options"
Charger worked great and plenty of open stalls. Conveniently off the highway but not many options nearby for things to do while you charge (just one restaurant that wasn't open at the time)
"Charger worked great, but they should better optimize their setup. Two of the four parking spots were taken by EVs that weren’t teslas, so they parked there to simply plug into the 110V outlet. Would be cheap to add 110V outlets in adjacent spots so that the Tesla chargers they installed remain available to Tesla cars that need them."
Charger worked great! Will use again
"Charger worked perfectly at about 135kWh and while the Kum & Go isn't fancy dining, there's something for everyone, even if it's just water and sunflower seeds."
"Charger worked well for me. Remember to navigate to superchargers on touchscreen so the battery pre-conditions for charging, otherwise in this cold weather if your battery is not totally warm yet you will see terrible charge rates even when the station works fine."
"Charger worked, but I had to open my charge door manually. Sheets, McDonald's, Dunkin and ice cream all nextdoor. Location is 5-10 minutes off I79. It is a nice little stop."
Charger works a little slower even when no cars around.. gas station is clean and Arby’s is right here!
Charger works great but you have to pay $15 to use it even if you are a guest at the hotel.
"Charger works great, nobody here when I got here (4:30am), and slightly sketchy location at night (behind TJ Maxx). The main downside: there's no trash or restrooms available off hours. I'm sure during the day you could pop into TJ Maxx to use the bathroom and kill some time though."
Charger works.
Charger wouldn’t go above 60kw. Before I arrived it said I only needed to be there for 15 min. I ended up having to stay 35 min. Switched stalls thinking it was just a bad stall same thing on the second one I hooked up to. Also there was only one car there 3 stalls away from the one I plugged into. Never had this happen before didn’t have a problem at the other 2 super chargers before this one. Idk what’s going on but not a very good experience.
"Chargers 2A/B were broken, but it’s the first Supercharger I’ve been to that’s within walking distance to a public library - great for restrooms, wifi, and some quiet space for reading.  A fancy Starbucks is also a short walk away."
Chargers always work which is all I really expect. Other reviews are the bathroom are accurate lol. Don’t use unless an absolute emergency. Chipotle and other restaurants to eat while you charge.
Chargers are a little beat up. Car charged for about 20min then it stopped and couldn't get it to work again.
"Chargers are a little slow (100Kw), but good location with access to many stores."
Chargers are All smashed
"Chargers are always empty, really quick place to charge!
The wawa is very clean, organized & well stocked"
"Chargers are arranged so you don’t have to back-in, which is nice, but not much other reason to charge here.  Burger King and a local chicken place (that was closed when I stopped) are only things within walking distance.  There is a gas station/convenience store across the highway."
Chargers are behind the store.
"Chargers are behind the Wendy's. Had to pay a toll when coming off highway. The Wendy's bathrooms are only open until 10 p.m, are only OK on cleanliness, and are only one person bathrooms (be ready to hold it!). In the grass near the chargers, there are signs asking you to not let pets pee or poo, but if you walk up beside the Wendy's there is another stretch of grass where you can get your pet some relief (as normal just take clean up bags...). There is a Starbucks/Ruby Tuesday/gas station nearish, bust you have to cross a busy road. Overall not my favorite stop..."
"Chargers are covered in a free parking garage (summer at least).  All in working order.  250kwh fast charging.
A grocery store and free gondola are a stones throw away.  All in all, a great charging oasis in the San Juan’s."
"Chargers are fast, neighborhood is ok. There’s not much convenient around, a gas station would be a better location"
"Chargers are good. They are super close to the gas pumps so that explains some of the negative comments. Low vibration people react to what's in their immediate presence.
I had an older gentleman come and talk to me while he was filling up. He was genuinely curious about the charge time.
The Casey's bathrooms are pretty nasty."
"Chargers are great, just not thrilled about this particular HyVee. There was ONE unisex bathroom available (located on right side of store about halfway back). Supposely other bathrooms but not 'working' today?! Also like others said, high traffic."
Chargers are great..location is in an empty remote area..no Restrooms No Stores..some on going construction..
"Chargers are in a resort, so there are several food options. Restrooms nearby and a lake view while charging. Two Tesla chargers and one universal j1772. Perfect if you are staying overnight ."
Chargers are in a shopping center parking lot. Starbucks and Chick-Fil-A are nearby.
Chargers are located behind the Dunkin Donut Lighting in charger area not on.  If wasn't for the light from the business next door it would have been very dark with just lights from the SC stalls.
Chargers are next to disabled parking. Curb is painted green for EV charging.
"Chargers are not maintained, all Tesla chargers were offline and 4 of of the 6 charging spots were blocked by gas cars."
"Chargers are offline and physically broken, one has been pulled off the post and is dangling from wires. New charge point chargers are next to them so likely the hotel has abandoned Tesla so they can charge for power."
Chargers are often not working or charing slowly.  In heavy rain you should avoid as you will be standing in 6 inches of water.  But ideal when handling high voltage
"Chargers are okay. Few chargers and charges pretty slow, so you gotta stick around a while.

The convenient store is great though. Clean restrooms, great barbacoa tacos, a lot of Mexican chips and candies, and it has a lot of variety."
Chargers are slow. Only car here and couldn’t get more than 56kW. Gonna give myself 5% breathing room to get to Halifax and and the 250kW chargers.
"Chargers at a Wawa. Tesla in-vehicle map showed only one open charger for 30 minutes ahead of our entry; but when we arrived, 4 were open.  Map still showed one when we left and 4 were open."
"Chargers at the Somerst turnpike service station, at the truck end of the car section. This was 2% charge further eastbound than the Somerset exit charger that’s behind a fast food place, so worth editing the car’s recommendation. Zero others used a charger during my charge at 4PM on weekday in summer"
Chargers don’t charge. Tried both destination chargers and they kept disabling charging.
"Chargers functional, Hy-Vee a good place to get food. Good place assuming it's not winter."
Chargers in a great easy access location. Hilton is beautiful inside. One of our main stops .Friendly staff.
"Chargers in a tight parking lot at the Cousins Inn (they're under the enormous Fairfield Inn sign but not located at that property). We ate at Cousin's Restaurant, as it was closest. Service and food were fine. Grass for pets."
Chargers not powered
Chargers often being held up by ICE/Gas cars. There should be a tow sign.
Chargers only performed at 8kw
"Chargers put in bad place, lots of gas cars blocking chargers. However can’t blame them there is no other parking options. Charger also was low on charging speed even though battery was pre-conditioned before arriving."
Chargers seem to be valid 250kW; I get the full charging rate (over 1000MPH) when I arrive with a battery below 20% and pre-conditioned (warmed).  I think some folks just don't understand how charging speed depends on state of the battery (state of charge and temperature) or how chargers are paired (A&B).  Decent amenities at the shopping center.
"Chargers were all working. Not enough garbage cans, seems people don't want to walk that far and just dump wherever they please. Such a shame 😞"
Chargers were ok but in a very bad area! Avoid! Wawa store was absolutely disgusting 🤢
"Chargers were readily available when needed.  There are a total of 12 at this location.  Charging was very efficient as I was able to add over 200 miles in just under 30 minutes. .  Ensure that, before going, you enter the supercharger destination into your navigation so that it preconditions the battery.  That will ensure an optimal charging process."
"Chargers work and I’m glad that chargers are available along Hwy 1.  Not a whole lot is around but you can get  car parts, groceries and pizza.  A McDonalds and a coffee drive-thru is available within short walking distance."
Chargers work great. Area is bad. Lots of transients.
Chargers work great. Location is odd. It is behind a mall that is pretty run down. Plus the mall closed at 6:00 on a Tuesday night.
Chargers work well. Lots of other places to park if you need to wait for a charger to open up. Parking in a charging stall after charging has completed is limited to 30 minutes.
"Chargers work, not too busy & a trash can. Not too walkable but is a Starbucks on the other side of the parking lot."
Chargers worked as expected. Plenty of vehicles came and went while we charged. Charging rate was as expected and everyone was considerate of the V2 split charging rule.
"Chargers worked at decent speed and no one else there at 8am. Nothing else around unless you want to go into casino. Be warned that, if there is concert or event at casino, you will not be able access chargers due to massive traffic backups."
Chargers worked great. In the parking lot of Hy Vee’s grocery store - bathrooms were clean at 7am. The charger looks different from the others but still works great.
Chargers worked great. Located in a gas station parking lot. The gas station serves hot food and there is a Burger King within walking distance.
Chargers worked great...people inside at Casey's were nice...great seletion for a small store. Nice to see the gas/electric stations starting to pop up.
Chargers working just fine. Super convenient location with food available 24/7
"Chargers works great, when gas vehicles aren’t parked in front of them."
Charges are incredibly slow at this location. I would not recommend stopping here unless you’re desperate.
Charges are next to comfort in.  They are also near Irving gas station.  Ether one can be used for a pit stop.  All charges are positioned in a way that you don't need to back in.
"Charges are on the north side of the mall . Only downside is you have to go into the mall during business hours in order to use the restroom. There's not a restroom exactly right here, but there's plenty of businesses nearby. I'm giving five stars because there was a local resident who owns a Tesla who was stopping by to clean up trash in the area. He likes to do it so that out of towners can appreciate a clean Tesla supercharger station"
Charges at 8kW. Folk in Inn are very kind.
"Charges at 9.6kW. My model 3 showed 37 miles per hour. The mark on the map is off. There are 4 chargers front row parking to the shops. Since there is no anti icing signage... The spots are regularly blocked. If you are lucky enough to get a spot... Expect door dings.

Nice enough for a free charge... But unless you get there early in the morning... Or late at night... You probably can't use it. Wish they had signage and towing.

Better off just driving to the super charger by Harris Teeter."
Charges at less than 65 kW/hour when no other cars share charger.
"Charges well enough, definitely one of the longer ones if you need to charge past 80%. Lit well enough, no trash cans, no restrooms late at night."
"Charges work great and fast. Down side, the hotel is being remodel, gas station across the street has bathroom closed and garbage all over. There is however a TA on the other side of the freeway to use their restrooms so if you gotta go, stop there first then charge up."
"Charging area nice. Walking distance to restaurants, DSW, Whole Foods.

CAUTION:  i went hiking 2 miles away at Hominy Creek where MY TESLA WAS VANDALIZED (deep paint knifing on 2 panels).  I was the ONLY car in the parking lot.  I immediately checked out of my hotel and i will NEVER GO TO ASHEVILLE again.   It's a city of Tesla haters.  Don't leave your car unattended."
"Charging around 465mph. Starbucks inside the meijer, which is very nice! Firehouse subs and few other eating options with walking distance."
"Charging at 131kw with no one around. That's a record for my model y. (~618 mi/hr). Was $0.39/kwh when I visited mid week mid day

Black Bear Diner even has a nice set of outdoor benches around a fire pit next to their parking lot makes for a good place to wait."
Charging at 35 mph. Tesla model S. Thanks to Dr Hope.
"Charging away, charging away, away we go back down the road to the next charging station. is the way we go."
Charging cables are worn out and  and wont work properly and the surroundings are not clean.
"Charging hasn't gone above 178 mph for me even though I am the only car charging. When charger was first installed 2 years ago we coud get over 500 mph. Location is great, but I wish it were faster."
Charging here is very close to hotels and food options.  New staircase to thia food is nice addition.
"Charging is def very slow at this one . You all need a SC in Sandy springs area not sure why one would come to Roswell before Sandy springs. Need more closer, should not have to go all the way out for a charge."
Charging my 21 S Plaid at 33mph!
"Charging my new Tesla brought me to my first visit to Wawa…and I was pleasantly surprised. Great vibes! Snacked on some fries, hopped on a quick zoom meeting, sang karaoke (c’est arrivé by Les chauds lapins), and chatted with an elderly couple curious about how the chargers worked. Very cool modded cars stopped by this station too. On my way to Edison from West Philly, this was a nice stop. Minus one star because of uncomfortable feeling given off by two parked gas trucks parked on charger spots…but overall 🤌 great vibes"
"Charging speed was ok for us - not as slow as others reported. Really nice spot - lots of grass for dog, picnic tables, swing set. There is a pizza place (Prairie Pizza), but it wasn’t open when we were there."
Charging spots are always open and have never been blocked for me. Short walk into sheetz. Easy to get to from the main road.
"Charging stall 1B may be broken.  Wouldn’t exceed 20kw charging.  Switched to 2B, charging returned to roughly 146kw."
Charging started at 113kw (I was in stall 2A). It's always good to see a high rate.  Stalls are inline with no shade. A Wendy's (inside the big Flying J gas station) is a 30 second walk.
Charging station
Charging station at an excellent location
"Charging station is fine,  just not much around other than a small pharmacy"
"Charging station located right off the 880 freeway. Easy access on your way to/from SFO or heading up to Sacramento. There are ample shops nearby while you wait for your Tesla to charge. Located right next to the Marshalls and Trader Joe’s, you can shop while you wait or walk over to Bay Street which is about a 7 minute walk.

Weekends during the day are pretty busy but come during the week, evening or during the day and you’re bound to find a place to charge. This station has 18 charging points available 24/7."
"Charging stations are great, just a little alignment issue with chargers to spaces but, the only real issue seems to be jack-n-the box employees parking in the shady charging spots"
"Charging stations are in a parking lot, right along side the road.  Not much here as far as amenities.  Sonic, a grocery store, and a nail salon.  There are a number of other fast food restaurants nearby, but this is not really a walking neighborhood.  Charging worked like it is supposed to though.  3 stars for lack of any amenities, charging is 5 star though."
Charging stations was  not accessible
Charging stations with electricity provided by coal and natural gas.   I want to see the charging station hooked directly to a wind turbine or solar panel (or at least some brain washed climate protester turning a crank to generate the charge).
Charging was fast and clean. Nearby park benches seem like an adequate size for late night romance.
"Charging was fast on a Sunday afternoon in February 2021. The car was charged at up to 50kWh and it took only 35 minutes to full charge; from 66 miles down. Maybe, we just got lucky.

The surrounding area is cute. There is a public garden, a free little library, a mini jailhouse museum and an Echo Coop store. There also is a little mall across the street.
AirBnB lodging is less than 2 minutes away at 11815 Powder House St."
Charging was fast. The General Store has a good selection of food and even gloves for little kids. Restrooms were clean.
"Charging was fine. Close enough to the entrance of the hotel that it seems like it wouldn't feel too isolated or creepy at night. Restrooms in the Holiday Inn Express are not great -- just one toilet for women and one for men, and not especially clean. No one was at the front desk when I went in, so not sure if they'd give you a hard time. A couple of restaurants nearby and a Walmart within walking distance. Very congested to get there from I-64, at least at 5 pm on a weekday."
Charging was great. My recommendation  is to put trash cans in the area.
Charging was pretty fast. Restaurants nearby but nothing open at 9:30 in the morning. Luckily hotel a cross the large parking lot had a bathroom!
Charging was seamless and everything worked perfectly.
Charging was SUPER slow at this location. The restroom in Clarks restaurant was clean. The gift shop was cute and gave me something to look at while charging. A trash can was available and had room for more trash.
Charging was very fast. At the mall so there are things to do and eat. Also near a Wegmans.
Check in at the B&B to pay your suggested price if $20 to use the charger.  The owner has to unlock the fuse box to turn on the charger.
"Check out the Jameson Tavern is you’re looking for a moderately priced, delicious meal.

LL Bean’s flagship store is across the street and is open 24/7/365 if you need a bathroom."
"Check out the Tillamook Creamery across the street complete with a large food court (yes, there is fresh ice cream), a gift shop, tours and restrooms. Don’t skip it!"
Checked all the basic boxes. Reliable
Chestnut Hill shopping plaza and a pond and trail to walk while you charge. Great spot
Clean
Clean & well lit area. Lot's of convenient places to hang out & shop while charging.
Clean and convenient supercharging in the corner of the Napa Outlets.
Clean and convenient. Easily accessible from I91-N. Pride Gas Station is right next to the superchargers can grab a quick bite and refreshments.
Clean and easy to access
Clean and easy to get to. Its in a gas station parking lot so it's very convenient.
"Clean and easy to use, plenty of chargers so you don’t have to wait for your turn. My Model 3 rental charged from 10 to 80% in 20 minutes, while I shopped in target. Continently located"
Clean and easy to use.
Clean and everything works great!
Clean and Fast.
Clean and nice. A good rest stop nearby.
Clean and open.  Easy to get to and lots of options for food and snacks 😋
"Clean and quick, smart placement."
Clean and safe. Off the road but still in clear view! Enjoyed my snacks while waiting on my full charge.
Clean and well maintained area. Some people are weird and put cables on the ground so someone dot park next to them. Here is one..hope there not the many owners like him....
"Clean area, plenty of food options. Lots of space to strech. I've been here several times and always such a relaxing place."
Clean area. Easy to access chargers. Super fast charging. Couldn’t be better.
Clean area. Feels safe. Highly recommend.
Clean bathrooms and typical Wawa amenities. Plenty of open chargers.
Clean but only near the Hampton hotel (has restrooms on the 1st floor). There are 4 stations.
"Clean electrons, but right beside the dumpster. Busy place and smelly place."
Clean everything works
"Clean facilities in the hotel. Nice area to walk around. We picked up food on the way to the charger, and I was pleasantly surprised to find a really nice grassy area with picnic tables next to the chargers. Kids loved running around in it."
"Clean location, with lots of restaurants & shops, but tucked into the back corner (a little darker than most locals) and almost hidden!  Location at site would never have been my choice!"
"Clean restrooms and 3 options for made to order food: king wok, Qdoba and Starbucks. Very busy rest stop with 10 stalls which is nice. Dog park attracts some birds which is pleasant to listen to while charging. Large gas station with lots of snacks inside."
"Clean space, hotel has a clean bathroom, and shopping mall is well occupied with shops, but keep your wits about you here. Someone followed me from the highway to the empty supercharger station. I thought they were just going to the hotel, but then cornered me in a parking spot once I was plugged in and gave some sob story about needing cash. PD was there within 3 minutes of me calling though. Seems like a shady enough place that this behavior could catch on. Louisiana residents in surrounding towns generally avoid the city of Monroe."
Clean space. People take care of the general upkeep of the area. All the charging stations are operating. Convenient store has cleanish bathrooms and a good assortment of food and beverages.
"Clean stalls, but 1.5 chargers were not working and there is no trash cans or bathrooms around."
"Clean store, good food, great stop for super charging.  Charters were busy, but they had enough stalls to avoid wait."
"Clean V3 charging. Speedy and easy to get to.

It's in the parking lot of a Wawa so you can load up on tasty road treats and process fluid interchanges."
"Clean washrooms, convenience goods and restaurant."
"Clean wayside, includes Starbuck, Sbarro, and convenience store. Acceptable seating area to chill while charging. Vanilla charging area, bare bones otherwise."
Clean with many open spots
"Clean, and lots of stores. We were charging, walk to Applebees and had dinner. It’s located near a Hotel. The plaza has other shopping places. It’s not 250 but by the we were done eating it was almost a full charge."
"Clean, and the hotel is a great place to take a quick break on your journey!"
"Clean, close to Rudy's BBQ. Charge rate started at 145 kW with an initial SoC of 36%! During peak hours of the restaurant   non-Tesla vehicles do sometimes take up the charge spots."
"Clean, conveniently located right off of 83 and attached to a Sheetz that’s open 24 hours a day for roads snacks coffee and bathrooms. There are 8 V2 150 kWh stalls including one for cars towing trailers. I’d rate this supercharger an 8/10 because it’s not a V3 250 kWh charger and it doesn’t have a trash can and window washing station at the chargers. Over all a good place to stop for electrons though. Follow me on Instagram at @Mobtowngeorge"
"Clean, easy access to the hotel and was happy to see the windshield cleaner after all the bugs I pick up this time of year."
"Clean, easy to access, and numerous shop/eat locations nearby."
"Clean, empty, and fast. The Flying J has whatever you need to stock up on road trip goodies. The men's restroom was clean and plenty of stalls. There is a subway and cinnabon inside the flying J. there are patches of grass for pets to relieve themselves. Charging started strong and tapered as I approached 80%+. Cell reception (att) works well. I was on 5g with 3 bars."
"Clean, fast, lots of open stalls. They had a trashcan and squeegee for washing you windows at the chargers. Got some Steak and Shake and hit the road. Do be warned ⚠️  there is a Dino-Dictator who demands a toll, pay up or he will sick them on you!!  🦕 🦖 🐲 🦕"
"Clean, lighted, food within walking distance. Burger King, el Sombrero Mexican restaurant, Dollar General, UPS Store, O’Reilly Auto Parts."
"Clean, new and a great choice in location with plenty of food and snack options to rest and refuel on your trip!"
"Clean, plenty of room for my dog to stretch his legs, 8 stations, nobody else here on a Tuesday evening at 9PM, lots of shops and stores around. Located at a Sheetz. As of 8/9/22 charging rates are 0.36 / kWh"
"Clean, safe area behind a Wawa station."
"Clean, spacious, and safe charging spot."
"Clean, well lit, souvenir-tourist-travelstop stuff, hot and cold drinks and foods, snacks.   Clean Bathroom (men's), large, 8 individual toilet stalls, 10 or so urinals.  Everything was tiled and clean.
20 gas pumps.
8 Tesla Superchargers.  I checked the EV stations at night and in daylight. The EV chargers are on the edge of the parking lot, but well within the sight lines of the Store, and well lit at night.  No roof, though.
No non-Tesla chargers were visible.
There are small shops within walking distance (200m).
About 1 km west, on the access road, is Robert's Steakhouse.  Eat here!"
"Clean, well-lit parking lot next to a Holiday Inn Express and across the street from a gas station.

The 4 chargers are definitely shared. A Model X was connected to 1A and I was on 2B. I was charging at 60+ and immediately jumped up to 130+ when the Model X disconnected."
Clean. Glad we got another set of super chargers in pooler! That makes 3 now in the Savannah area. Keep it up Tesla doing great! Only gripe is there happens to be a dip right before the supercharger for drainage. If you have lowered your car be careful mine almost scraped. Just a heads up.
Clean. Safe. Good food and shopping nearby. Usually there is a space to charge right away.
"Clear, Easy to find, all stalls were working, and plenty of spots to park"
Close a supermarket that has a Starbucks. Service at the Starbucks was very slow when I was there.
"Close enough to I-90 and US 95 but the immediate vicinity is a head scratcher. It’s at the back corner of a parking lot with a Golden Corral (Google says it’s permanently closed) and a Buffalo Wild Wings. If you want to find a restroom, you have to walk on the road past all the trailer parks then around to the front of the Fred Meyer. And it’s only 150kW.

Northern Idaho deserves better but this is all you have."
"Close enough to stores to go visit to pass time if they are open, seems like a safe area, out in the open.  No issues with the chargers themselves. Thanks Telsa for the excellent supercharging network!"
"Close enough to the mall to be an easy enough walk, far enough to lessen the chances of being messed with. Barnes and Nobles is the closest entrance, which I think is a bonus. A mostly full charge for the 2016 I was in was exactly enough to circle the mall once."
Close to a Meijer that's open very late. Restrooms just OK. But they do have seating inside to eat. Also chargers are in the front of the building and visible. A walk across the large parking lot will get you to two different restaurants. Honestly one of our fav superchargers on our trip. Super convenient and people were friendly.
"Close to Disney + Championsgate but far enough away that it doesn’t get over busy. Wawa adjacent is fully stocked, too."
"Close to freeway, six stalls, and Starbucks next door. There's also a small field behind the chargers where you can let your dog be a dog."
"Close to highway, very nice and modern bathrooms. Take the light to get into the Kum&Go parking lot rather than the route telsa tells you (which could get you rear-ended). Nice covered picnic tables but also a spot for the homeless to hang out as well. Got nearly 250kw when I charged and there is a pull through charger for those towing something."
Close to lots of shops and stores. Well lite and clean. Easy to get out and onto the expressway.
Close to meijer and other restaurants. Place is not busy most of the time.
"Close to Michael's, Target, T-Mobile, Kohl's, Marshall's, CVS Pharmacy. Great location, not busy!"
Close to restaurants and Meijer. Was not busy.
"Close to retail, easy to get too. Could use more though, pretty full"
"Close to Starbucks and A&W: this charging station is well maintained and easy to find.
There’s no shelter or covering."
Close to the highway but best stuff is in town a mile away. Source of coffee for a lift and La Unica for great Mexican food. 120 kw and well lit here. Short walk to trucks top.
"Close to the highway makes for an easy stop but the exit doesn't have much around.  The fast food is a walk down a road without sidewalks and you likely wouldn't be back before you're done charging.  There is a small truck stop diner in the same parking lot though.  Overall, it will get you charged but don't expect much else."
Closed as of 2/12/2023 noon. Tesla didn’t indicate this until we reached this supercharger. Please check before planning on charging here.
Closed for repairs.
Closer to freeway! Little busy parking lot but chargers are always available!
Closest restrooms are in the Raley’s grocery store.  They’re located at the back of the store next to the pharmacy.
Closest toilet is across a busy street.
Coast Guard put two Tesla destination chargers and two SAE j1772 chargers there and they work terrific.
"Come here to top off since Port Charlotte is s black hole for charging. Today however, 70kw is the max i am getting and the SC is quite full of cars.
Big positive is Whole Foods is right next door with s craft brew bar and burgers.

Can't wait until this gets upgraded to v3. It's a busy one and it could use the boost."
Comically slow charger. These level 1s need to be all upgraded asap.
Complete nightmare to find almost ran out of battery trying to locate it but it is specifically in the large parking garage closest to Nordstrom’s on the second level. Lots of spots
"Consistently slower than full speeds here, usually top out around 100kw. Snow/ice removal has gotten better, bit with big storms some stalls can get blocked."
Constant non tesla cars are always parked here.
"Construction vehicles were parked for the entire morning. Mentioned it to the manager at Sheetz, and they claim that this was not their jurisdiction. It was Tesla's fault. BS."
Contrary to Google’s information these are actually 150 KW Superchargers and have provided the highest peak charging rate I’ve seen in the time I’ve had my Model 3 Performance - 147 KW!
Convenient
Convenient
Convenient
"Convenient , well lit location, out of the elements in bottom floor of parking garage under Trader Joe's in Ballard. Room for 8 Tesla's to charge simultaneously. Limited cell connectivity in this location (on T-Mobile). Easy access to Trader Joe's, PCC and other retailers while you top off."
Convenient 8kw 32A under tree shade. It saved my trip!
Convenient access to a few restaurants.
"Convenient access to beach, pier, and food while charging."
"Convenient access, right off I-85, adjacent to Sheetz in Thomasville, NC"
Convenient and clean.
Convenient and easy
"Convenient and nice to have in Boone, but not we're comfortable using pharmacy for restroom. It's a sit in the car charging station. Food not close by."
Convenient and safe location not too far off the expressway. Located in the meijer's parking lot and very easy to run in to pick up a few things while your car charges.
Convenient and safe parking lot with shops around it
Convenient as usual to the highway. Located in the parking lot of the Sheetz convenience store and gas station. Zaxby's is right next door and a Dairy Queen is about a mile down the road.
"Convenient but maybe not as easy as super chargers located at gas stations. Just a walk away from options for eating and stuff. Still, very easy to drive in and out, plus a supercharger that could accommodate a car that can’t back in (not pull thru but could pull nose in)."
Convenient but slow.
Convenient charger places because it is nearby Wawa. Wawa coffee is always the best while you are waiting for the car to be charged. Sometimes there are not a lot available spots and you will have to wait.
"Convenient from Interstate. Fast charger. The convenience store has good restrooms & serves fresh cooked food, mostly fried at a deli style counter. There is a mexican restaurant & a few fast food places in walking distance."
"Convenient location , there’s a store to buy goods, restrooms and dog area , BUT  not enough chargers only 8 spaces. It took so much to be able to continue our trip . Not really a Supercharger."
Convenient location and many charging stations
Convenient location and not crowded but VERY slow 87 mi/hr
Convenient location as it is not too far off the interstate. They have a trash can and window squeegee available for use at the chargers. Located next to a truck stop that has some food options but not a lot.
"Convenient location for McKinney, Frisco and Prosper locations. Parking lot is very small and during the day, the spots are taken by non-EV vehicles."
Convenient location for trips Northern Michigan trips. Chargers are much faster than we’ve experienced in the past which is great considering your options are limited North of Cadillac. Thank you Meijer!
Convenient location for us
Convenient location if you need to charge between Las Vegas and Kingman.   Nearby store and restrooms.
Convenient location in a HyVee parking lot. The only downside was their seasonal garden area made backing into a spot a bit challenging.
"Convenient location in a Sheetz parking lot. Sheetz provides restroom facilities, food, and other items that may be needed on a trip"
"Convenient location in Corvallis, with 3 charging spots. Friendly and supportive staff."
"Convenient location in Corvallis, with 4 charging spots. Friendly and supportive staff."
"Convenient location in the Outlet center, but if you go there before the store opens and need a bathroom.... you'll need to go to either Starbucks or a fast food place.   Limited number of chargers, but fairly fast."
"Convenient location in the Sheetz lot with 8x superchargers. The restrooms are clean and there’s a good selection in the convenience store. Breezewood has a lot of fast food, but the intersections are large and you may want to drive there after charging (as opposed to walking)."
"Convenient location near highway and nearby amenities (Sheetz, Tractor supply co., KFC, Dunkin’)"
"Convenient location off 1-80. Wasn't too full on Wednesday afternoon. I prefer locations at 24/7 gas stations for easy amenities so I probably would not stop here at night or off-hours. Besides Ruby Tuesday, there is also a Cracker Barrel on same side of the street otherwise the other options are across the busy road without a cross-walk. Why did the Tesla owner cross the road? To walk to the Starbucks."
Convenient location off I-80. Near a grocery store with a nice booth seating area inside to charge phone.  Also a Starbucks in the store.
"Convenient location off of I-15 in the back of the Clarion Hotel parking lot. There are several restaurants within walking distance (in good weather). The nearest restaurant is the Whispers Bar & Grill inside the Clarion. A bit more distant, there is an Applebee’s & a Perkins Cake & Steak."
Convenient location off the highway and near restaurants.  15 chargers 🔌 and not busy on a Sunday afternoon.  The garbage 🗑️ can was a plus.
Convenient location off the highway if you are staying or passing by Spoake. Has Starbucks and convenience store in the same lot.
"Convenient location off the highway.   Starbucks, Subway, Iron Skillet and Exxon station nearby for refreshment/bathroom needs.  8 v3 charging stations available, although 1 didn't work.  No line, only 2 other cars here while we charged.  Parking available for RVs and large trucks."
Convenient location outside a hotel.  There's a McDonald's and a couple gas stations within walking distance while you charge.
Convenient location right next to a grocery store and usually not very busy
"Convenient location to highways, the airport, and all the sports stadiums. It's great they are installing so many chargers in the Philly area. Also it's in the parking lot of a Wawa which is perfect."
"Convenient location to mall. You do have some walking to get to any of the stores because parking is in the back. Lots of other parking here so in all the trips we have made here, haven't seen any charging spots blocked."
Convenient location while traveling on 41. Trash can onsite and in the parking lot of Festival Foods.
"Convenient location,  all in working order."
"Convenient location, by the freeway. Not a lot of stalls, and the place is always busy. All that said, I do use it, and haven't had an issue with it. Tesla really needs to build more of these on the south end of the salt lake valley."
"Convenient location, clean restrooms to right of entrance, cafe on left side before you reach the casino"
"Convenient location, close to the highway as well as shopping and restaurants! Should be far enough away from the store entrance to deter most people in ICE cars from parking there just to be jerks."
"Convenient location, on McMasters Ave, just off US-61 and I-72 in the Casey's parking lot.  They have 8 chargers and some restaurants within walking distance include- Sonic, Long John Silver's and McDonald's.

This was my first Supercharger experience after having my Model 3 SR+ for 2 years and was pleased at how simple and fast it charged.  Got about 100 miles in 25 minutes which was plenty of charge to get me back to Saint Louis."
"Convenient location, right off the I-70 freeway. There is construction going on but 4/8 Superchargers are accessible."
"Convenient location, yes. Superchargers great. Bathrooms just ok. However, if you're stopping for food, I'd say skip it. The food prices were jacked up for convenience and the food was sub par."
"Convenient location.  At Sheetz, close to hotels and shopping."
Convenient location.  But 1 of 4 is not changing.
Convenient location.  Fast charging.   Easy on and off freeway access.
Convenient location. Close to restaurants and shopping.
Convenient location. Next to Starbucks and Chick-Fil-a. Located at a Parker's Kitchen gas station. Bathrooms needed a little cleaning. Charging good. 250kW. Decent walking distance to other stores.
Convenient location. Not too busy on a holiday.
"Convenient location. Rarely busy. Located in the Target parking lot. You can walk around the store, get coffee or use the restrooms."
"Convenient place off I-70 with large number of chargers, super fast and the kicker, cheaper electric rates."
Convenient place to charge in Wburg… valet staff is very nice. You use your phone to pay $8 to park to charge (cheaper than in Manhattan)
Convenient place to charge since it's at a Target parking lot... You can shop and get stuff to eat at the same time
Convenient place to charge when visiting Yellowstone. Not free and more busy at night. Protip: charge to 80% at the supercharger then use a wall charger at your hotel to get the remaining 15% overnight.
"Convenient place, fast charge and lots of things to do while you wait."
Convenient safe location at Sheetz Gas Station. Fast charge at 129kW. Well lit with good foot traffic.
Convenient spot with Wawa and restaurants nearby.   Maxed out at 100 kWh despite preconditioning
Convenient stop at Sheetz and 250kW charging. We stopped at McDonalds off the exit then came to charge 0.31/kWh.
Convenient stop for trips to and from the Triangle and the beach. Not busy so far. We'll see in the summer.
Convenient stop when on the go. The cost is a bit higher than other places I've stopped at but it's still way cheaper than gas
"Convenient Supercharger located in Easton, MD.  If you are headed South on Rt. 13, there is a charger in Salisbury, then no more on the Eastern Shote of Virginia until you get to Norfolk.  Charge up here!  250kw chargers.  The Royal Farms has good snacks, but the bathrooms here are usually pretty unkempt. Also, there are really no other places to get food in walking distance, the Royal Farms is it…"
Convenient supercharger!  In the Target shopping center and very close to several dining options!
"Convenient Tesla supercharger with a nice lounge, clean bathrooms, wine tasting and a food truck. We ordered the Ribeye Philly Cheesestake, it was very tasty and the bread was nicely toasted and not soggy. The owner was nice and helpful. This is a good stop to charge your car and eat some quality food."
Convenient to bars and restaurants on the Asylum Ave block in case you have to wait and hour to charge
Convenient to Big Y; restrooms inside - way on the left.
Convenient to charge while enjoying lunch.
Convenient to charge while zip lining. Charges Model 3 @ 46 miles/hour. Very close to Red River Gorge cabin rentals.
"Convenient to I-495. There are plenty of open chargers every time I arrive.

The chargers are next to a Panera that allows walk-ins and pit stops. There are other stores in the mall, but most are a bit of a hike. I'm not sure I could walk over, shop, and be back before charging completed."
"Convenient to I-90; 12 chargers, no waiting. Right behind the Denny’s."
Convenient with multiple charging station. Next to I-10 interstate freeway and usually not that busy. Next to few hotels and restaurants. My favorite restaurant is Rudy’s country style BBQ. You can actually see your car charging from the window while having food.
"Convenient, always finding availability and the grocery store is a handy place to send time.  Subway close by too."
"Convenient, fast charge, clean, safe. Would stop here again to charge up on my way in to Baltimore."
"Convenient, right off Rt. 84 and next to Pepe's Pizza and Dunkin Donuts."
"Convenient, safe location very close off 95 in the Hampton parking lot. It seems like most traveling south will stop at the Smithfield location instead of here.  Food locations aren't on site, so you'll either have to walk about 1/8th of a mile,  or eat after charging."
"Convenient, stalls readily available well lit and the police did several drive through during my 25 minute visit"
Convenient.  2 chargers available.
Convenient. Great food options nearby
"Convenient. In and out.

""That's what she said."""
Convenient. Large and busy convenience store with food.
"Conveniently at Royal Farms.
Also many nearby places on Route 50 to pick up a snack on the way to enjoy while charging.

Well lit with nearby police patrols.

Big contrast to the Salisbury Supercharger which is in a desolate parking lot at night with no bathroom, food, or convenient shops after hours."
Conveniently located
"Conveniently located around the side of the Wawa. Plenty of space between chargers. Easy to move your car when charging is complete.

Since it's a 250. You can be back on your way quickly."
"Conveniently located at a Wawa station, this super charger is well-placed with easy access. You can pitstop here for a quick top up and grab a coffee while you wait. There are plenty of restaurants behind it as well within walking distance. Enjoy.🤙🏻"
"Conveniently located at bucees, very easy access and great food/restroom option."
"Conveniently located behind a hotel and next to a restaurant, there are other restaurants nearby."
"Conveniently located from the entrance of Orangeburg County in the Spinx gas station and car wash center with 8 level III supercharging stations. Overall charg6 experience was great, very discord and clean!!"
"Conveniently located in Springfield right off of I5. There are 14 superchargers, 2 were not working when we visited but I’m sure they will be fixed soon. There are restaurants within walking distance to grab a bite to eat while charging & hotels if staying the night."
"Conveniently located in the back of La Encantada, these SuperChargers appear to be in good working condition and you can't offer a better backdrop than the beautiful Catalina Foothills.  Within short walking distance are plenty of great dining options, and Savaya Coffee Market - a nice little coffee shop where I happen to be writing this review from."
"Conveniently located in the Kum & Go gas station, fast charging 250 kWh"
Conveniently located in the Meijer parking lot. Went on a weeknight and there were several charging spots available. Also have a non Tesla charging spot as well.
"Conveniently located in the parking garage one floor just below the eagle grocery store.
Busy area but everyone charges fast and leave not blocking the stalls."
"Conveniently located just off I-70, but besides a Jimmy John's across the street, there isn't much within walking distance. Charger is a bit slower than the other Supercharger in Columbia."
Conveniently located near a gas station. Comfortable to wait. Quick charge. 17% to 100 in 1 hr
"Conveniently located near a lot of attractions to spend time while the car charges. Train rides for kids looked like a lot of fun, rides and bungee jumping for the brave hearts in parking lots and bungholes for all ages were all great flavor."
"Conveniently located near a Meijer this location was clean, had a place to walk a dog, trash cans and was moderately busy but I still managed to pull about 70-100 Kwh on a 32 degree day in my 2019 M3SR+.  Other restaurants nearby."
"Conveniently located next to Lowes foods around the side in the shade (depending on the time of day.)
Not a particularly busy charger, even for being off the interstate and in a heavily “Teslated” area (saw dozens of S3XY’s within a mile.) Maybe about half the stalls were in use the whole time.
Only downside was that it only kicked out 135KW despite preconditioning and not being particularly busy. Definitely not a true 250KW despite what Tesla maps might claim."
Conveniently located North of Hartford. Near to Pride store and deli.
"Conveniently located off of 41, in the Pleasant Prairie Premium Outlets.
120 kW max, 8 stalls and no down ones in my last 4 visits.
Public restrooms but not 24 hour."
Conveniently located off the highway for easy access. Only fast food options available. Doesn't seem to be a very busy location though.
"Conveniently located off US-64, with a Bojangles within walking distance. Located on the northeastern side of the hotel's parking lot."
"Conveniently located on the I-78 exit 49-A inside WAWA which has food and restroom options. Total of 12 charging spots at this location.

Suggestion: Please put trash cans so people don't throw their trash here and there."
Conveniently located right off Rt 1 .. nice location .. I generally don’t use this one because it is very expensive .. it’s about 0.43$ pwkh.. almost double the price .. Wawa is good too. Overall e expensive but nicely located .
Conveniently located right off the interstate 79. Sheetz convenience store with washrooms and great Hampton Inn across the road if you need an overnight stay.
"Conveniently located to food, shopping and other things. Not that fast, 150kw max but that doesn’t matter so much.

Every time we were here we had to come back and get the car before we hit idle fees because we found something else great to explore."
Conveniently located with v3 250kW charging rates. Grocery store with Starbucks inside. Multiple well-labeled charging stalls. Easy to get to from highway and resume journey.
"Conveniently located, close to a Target where you can shop, use the restrooms. Also lots of food options close by."
"Conveniently located, easy on off from the highway and fast charging. All the stalls seem to be new and operable.

Dislocation is back in only, normally you see at some stations at least one spot that's pull-in but none here are like that."
Conveniently next to a Target. A bit dark at night though
Conveniently placed close to a gas station! We were able to grab some necessities for the rest of our trip. On this one particular occurrence a third Tesla pulled up and blew the breaker in the last three chargers. Pretty sure it is fixed by now.
"Conveniently placed near some shops, took a quick break at the nearby bakery while charging. Charge however does not go up to 250kw speeds"
"Conveniently placed Super Charger. Quiet little town, lots to see and many antique shops. 250kw max charging. Shops and bars around."
"Convinient location and a good number of chargers. Version 3 chargers are built, but not working yet. I judge charging locations not only by the number of chargers but availability of bathrooms and snacks.   Price chopper market has both. The bathrooms are at the end of isle 9, on the opposite side from the entrance.  There two bathrooms, unisex, and very dirty - wet floor, paper towels on the floor, no toilet paper. However close to the chargers."
Cool but really how many tesla are in town??
Cool Lil spot but you better cut everything off if you want a Fast Charge
"Corner of 8th and Bridger but the entrance is on 8th.  Someone removed the Tesla sign that was once on the wall outside.  Two chargers on the left, four on the right."
"Cost $8 to park all day, but no additional charge to use one of the. Two 110 volt charging stations."
"Costs $10 entry for the general parking, inside parking garage, once inside, just keep straight, you will see it. No signs posted. Conveniently next to an entryway onto the Harborwalk too!"
Costs $40 :/
Could not find it!! WTH??
"Could not get pass 79kW. battery was at 12%, and was preconditioned for roughly 30+ miles before I got there. there's were no other cars charging at the time."
Could not locate an actual charger for a Tesla?!
Could use a window washer station.
Could use some more food options since JRs closed. Hopefully royal farms opens soon
Couldn't find
"Couldn't plug in my Ford Escape, thought looks cool."
"Couldn't tell ya, too poor to afford a Tesla, but from what I've seen while getting gas or air in tires if needed and if the air pump works it def seems to be a good meeting spot to make deals aka sale dope lmao"
"Couldn’t find it at first. I went in to ask where it was, afraid that they were going to tell me it was only for hotel guests. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful and didn’t care if I was staying there or not."
Couldn’t find it. Gave up and pushed it home. It would be nice if there were signs letting you know where it was. NOT COOL
"Courteous owner. Charged tesla for reasonable price. Not a supercharger, but best option in the area!"
Covered area for your Tesla to charge.
Covered garage! What else is there to say?
"Covered parking, plenty of stalls, Noah's Bagels. On the way to and from the mountains, and right off the freeway. Perfect!"
"Crazy fast charger! When I went there was almost no one there. Taco Bell and shopping center nearby, but you don’t have much time to shop!"
"Crazy thing is I sit in the parking spaces nearby the charging station to dream build MY Tesla. Ever since I test drove a Model X, I knew I had to have one. My children even loved it. While I may not own one yet I will very soon! I love knowing that the charging station is at the shopping center I frequent as well as within 10 minutes from my home."
Crowded but open spots. Charging is slower when so many cars charging at the same time. But still got from 28 miles to over 100 in about 15 minutes.
"Crowded, not fastest charging, very expensive, ~$18 for 100 miles only! double the fee when 9-5pm (didn’t even notice when first time go there)"
"Crucial “junction” to get to and from a clients property located south of Sonora Texas from Dallas - very glad this was added (or that it exists, not sure when it was added). Pictures added represent how it allowed us to get out to a very desolate property to install some off grid hardware. Partly drove for experimental purposes, it was success!"
"Currently (as of Aug 6th) showing ""reduced Service"" on Tesla in car navigation. Due to adjacent construction, 3 of the stalls are blocked. However, the remaining stalls are functioning perfectly. So, just know that it is possible that, if it shows ""3 stalls available"" you might have a wait if the 5 actually available stalls are full. But this is not typically a very busy Supercharger.

The ""Texas Best BBQ"" that is listed as an amenity is under construction and not yet open, but there is an ""Eco-Loo"" restroom on site and there is a Valero nearby (within site) for refreshments in until the BBQ place opens."
Currently charger 3B has a messed up charger plug. Needs serviced/repaired.
Currently isn't working
"Currently, not many superchargers in southern utah and this is quick one next to many places. Been here many times, max got is close to 600 miles per hour charge. Usually plug in as going north and get close to 100%, stop by first watch eat and then go again.

10 minutes from highway but two exit, not as big of detour as you think. Also, not close to highway.

Usually no one there but also seen every stall full."
Cute Motel off hwy 85 north
Damaged.
dang thing caught my poor chevy sonic on fire!
"Dangerous place to stop at night.
Near a dumpster.
No bathroom.
No facilities.
Solitary."
DANGEROUS TRAFFIC at this location. You are on what amounts to a MAIN thoroughfare. CAUTION as you back into stall. Cars will zip around you. BEWARE!
Dealer leaves unattended cars in the charging station. Meanwhile there's a cue of cars waiting for a spot to open up. Waited 40 minutes while 5 spots were taken up by the dealer that where there before I arrived and where still there after I left.
Dec 19/22. Charging station 48.  Prongs bent.  Station 46 is good to go.  Charging started at 240kw.
"Decent amount of chargers not a busy location, easy in and out. I just wish there were more food options or a closer bathroom, not the chargers fault, just FYI."
"Decent charger, it's tucked way back.  Drive towards the big Meijer sign on the right side of the building - you'll see it when you get close enough. 300 to 400 miles an hour with 2 cars charging."
Decent charger. Six stalls. Solid charging speed. No queue on a Friday morning when I stopped here.
"Decent charging speed and public restroom in the nearby hotel, but no good area to relieve a dog."
Decent charging station is the wonderful community of Cinnamon Shores. Congratulations to the developers and residents. Nice surprise on our road trip.
Decent charging stop right off I 76. Adjacent convenience store with friendly employees keeping the place clean. Good Subway restaurant location as well.
"Decent charging time, but a little expensive. Wawa was super busy when I went at 9pm. It was a good amount of chargers though, and it wasn’t too sketchy."
Decent convenience. Not the best for walking to restaurants etc. In the Arby's parking lot.
Decent little gas station parking lot. Not much else around.
"Decent little spot for a Supercharger. It’s located next to a gas station / truck stop with a small local restaurant, “Huddle House,” attached. The Citgo staff is very friendly and the bathrooms are outdated but clean. Lots of grass to walk the pup, but beware of ants; there were a ton of any hills in the grass. Would have given more stars if the fast food option nearby were walkable."
Decent location (three fast food options and a gas station nearby). Not enough charging stations. Every time I’ve come through here they’ve always been ~90-100% utilized. Gas station >unfriendly
"Decent location and number of chargers.  In plaza with a Firehouse subs, Moe's and Chili's.   Landlord should clean up the trash area though.  See picture."
Decent location but only 2 chargers and one of them doesn't work.
"Decent location with several restaurants, a convenience store, a supermarket, and a fitness center within a short walking distance.  I've never had to wait to charge, but frequently get to see other owners nearby.

It took me about 31 minutes to charge from 37% to 88% in my Tesla Model 3 (Long Range, AWD), just enough time to walk over to Culvers, order, eat, and walk back.

In the past, I've had problems with Stall 1A limiting charge rate to 23kW (even without being shared), but I haven't noticed this recently (still was charging at 50 kW at 80% charge).

5 stars would be earned with additional restaurants being slightly closer and a covered awning/shelter for rainy/winter weather.  Otherwise this location is great!"
"Decent location, mall parking lot, 1/4 mile from main road."
"Decent location... right off I99 and I80, but poor charging speeds took me 60 min to charge up to 86 miles on my Model X. There is a liquor store, Weiss market (supermarket + beer shop) and Wendy’s nearby. It’s convenient for me to stop if I desperately need a charge. But it’s the only supercharger in the immediate area."
"Decent place for a quick charge. From the reviews, Arby's ended up being the better choice for food instead of next door's accommodations."
"Decent speed and many chargers, but in blazing sun. Grassy area with lots of prickly weeds directly behind - dog didn’t love it. McDonald’s and Meijer store are walkable."
"Decent speed supercharger, but a bit out of way if heading into Chicago. Food options. On outskirts of mall. Big grassy areas for dogs."
"Decent speeds, well lot location near fast food and convenience stores. Hotel lobby staff were kind and welcoming, and the lobby bathroom was clean."
"Decent supercharge.  Often a lot of trash in the area from less than conscientious users.  150KW max.  Been there several times where we were the only car.  Been there times where it was completely full and everyone was power-sharing.  Quite a ways off the Interstate with a lot of poorly timed stopped lights between.  Several miles North of I-10.  We try to skip this one, charging at the Level 3 charger in D'Iberville instead."
"Decent supercharger, left turn into area from freeway is a bit sketchy."
"Decent supercharger. Easy on & off the freeway. 13 stalls, 250kW max. Also 6 high speed EVolution chargers for other EVs. Several fast food eateries, coffee, and a market in the complex as well."
"Decent supercharger. Garage area is pretty dirty, but supercharger was right where I needed it. No wait on a weekday morning at 9am."
"Decent Tesla destination charger. If you go past the lobby and take a right at the stop sign, then right into the Additional Parking garage it's on the left. There's only one Tesla charger and a GE charger I'd never seen before."
"Decent V2 supercharger with access to Dunkin’ and a pizzeria. The taco bell is a bit far.

It does appear that this location is enabled with Wi-Fi too - my car auto connected to tesla-vehicle at this supercharger"
"Dedicated parking lot with parking for non-Tesla vehicles. 20 stations with nearby shops, restaurants and fast charging. Easy access to I5 freeway."
"Deep in the outskirts of the parking lot right side of the Meijer.

250KW

Fast chargers, but the bathroom is on the opposite side of the chargers. Left side of the Meijer. Pro tip. Drop off the peeps that need to use the bathroom in the ""home"" entrance."
"Definitely 3 Tesla Destination chargers but only 2 were functional on 29 May, 2019. Reported to the front desk. Malfunctioning charger is the first of the three if you start with the one closest to the entrance driveway and count back toward the rear of the hotel."
Definitely a charger with an acceptable amount of things to do as long as your family likes shipping.
Definitely a hidden gem no other Tesla showed up when I went to charge. There is a liquor store and dq for some snacks. Lots of truckers come bye
"Definitely have to pay for parking now. $3 first hour. Restaurants no longer can validate your ticket. Confirmed at Mugshots and at coffee shop. A recent change. The exit is automated with gate, no attendant, so don’t lose your ticket. Stopped there around noon on a Thursday.  The charge is a standard amount of $10 or more for games, but maybe an attendant then to negotiate with.  Only two stars because Birmingham needs alternative location.  The Mahi Mahi was good at Mugshots but had to chase the servers to order and pay in less than an hour."
Definitely more chargers needed. I didn't have to wait long but while there there was a wait up to 5 vehicles.
Definitely need more chargers!!! Too many cars waiting and not enough stations in the area. Shocking not one in King of Prussia. Supercharger is the way to go! Really fast
Definitely need more stations like this. 22 min drive. Dont have a fast charger at home. Not sure if it is because I am getting close to full charge but it just dropped from 84kw to 19kw.
"Definitely NOT 250 kW. Stations are numbered 1a through 1d, 2a through 2d, and 3a and 3b.
No other food options then very grubby street tacos."
"Definitely one of the best views you can ask for at a supercharger. I will say though, I’m kinda disappointed my charge capped out at 107kW and didn’t reach the full 150. I was the only car here and tried multiple booths but that’s okay!"
"Definitely recommend. Lots of charges, no fee for parking"
"Definitely some sketchy folks around.  Wish it was closer to stores other than Winn Dixie but it's by the highway.
I'm really glad they put one in arcadia anyway.  Makes it much easier to cross the state on SR70."
"Dennys parking lot on a ""stroad"".  Not a good place to eat while charging"
"Designed by the same man  who did Central Park in NY! An arboretum, beautiful trees, pickle ball courts,& windy paths & fountains. Awesome park!"
"Despite 250 kW rating, my Model X charged slowly. Drove 25 miles before charging but charger thought battery was cold and I sat for 15 minutes before charging started. Never got above 110 miles per hour charge rate. Used same location a few days before, different charger, but still two vehicles on the same circuit  and got normal initial charge rate of 400+ miles per hour. Implies poor maintenance by Tesla and this is a very busy Supercharger location."
Despite listing 250kw only pulling 70 with one other Tesla. Diverted just for the speeds. Bathrooms at royal farms are horrible. Just go to the 95 rest stop and charge.
"Destination charger (free as of March 2021)  is faster than I thought. We camp in our tesla at standard electric sites back at home. This destination charger is comparable (in amperage and timing until a full charge) with the standard electric campsite: about 6-7 hours to top your car. F. Ex. 15-20 amp (regular house outlet) would take 24+ hours. About the place overall - it is a nice still developing, yet already developed neighborhood with some restaurants and beach access.
We went out to a pizza place ""Dylan's pizza"" to check out and spend some time. It was a very good choice we made!"
"Destination charger at TownePlace Suites. Works great, charged overnight when staying at the hotel for a few nights. Can't wait for the Supercharger to open this year though."
Destination charger not working. Went there about an hour before opening. Not sure why Tesla would direct us there if they are for customers only (which we were willing to be) just a heads up for others that may need a charge in the area.
"Destination charger on the side of a Hampton Inn. Found myself low on charge miles away from any real charging infrastructure and the folks here were nice enough to let me charge even though I wasn’t staying there.  The chargers are all usually turned off at the breaker.  Why?!?  I can’t imagine charger abuse has become a problem at this location.  Secondly the staff, while helpful, do not fully understand how to turn on the charger.  If you have trouble and are able to follow the front desk kid into the electrical room, there are two breakers required to activate the charger one on the main and one on a sub panel. Both are labeled."
Destination chargers are located at the back of the property.  They are both working.
"Destination chargers worked well. Just plug in and it charges. It was a bit on the slow side but effective none the less.

A bit if clarification, if you use an adapter, other EVs can charge here with no issue.

Destination chargers are, by and large, ClipperCreek EVSEs with a Tesla charging cable.

Used a J1172 adapter for my Bolt EV."
"Did not show up as a super charger on the Tesla Google Map but absolutely working and lots of shopping nearby. 100 feet away from Starbucks and Panera bread but pretty much everything from lodging to eatery  close by. Didn’t have to wait until Mobile, AL on I-10 after Defuniak Springs."
"Did the job. The middle of 3 chargers was available. We used the adaptor, jumped in an ICE car, went to lunch and came back. College Station, let's get some Tesla Superchargers please."
Didn't do much for my diesel truck
Didn't have to wait at all!
"Didn't use as I was in a motorhome. Don't know if the Tesla driver was on autopilot or screwing around with his phone, but he cut dangerously close in front of me in a hurry to get to one of seven available spot."
Didn't use it. I used a gas burning car.
Didn’t work. They seem like old chargers
Didnt work on my z4 as it's not an electric car.
"Difficult to find and very slow, charges about 35 miles per hour. In a weird spot between the CVS and Best Western. Two chargers, completely free. Someone stopped by while I was charging and said car would be towed if I left it there."
"Difficult to find, and there is no signage. My car's GPS took me to the wrong side of the street. It is in the basement level of the mall parking under Trader Joe's and Ross. On the plus side there's a cafe and donut shop in the building and the chargers were empty."
Directions were correct
"Directly across from Donna's Designs, which is between the Kids Store and the Barr-ee Station.  Like you're heading toward the Blue Point restaurant."
"Directly connected to the mall parking lot. Lots of options for food, bathrooms and it's very well lit. Noticeable security presence driving around at night. Great charging spot."
"Dirty, no trash bin. Restroom available at Hilton Garden Inn."
Do not rely on this Charger. I went there 8/28/22 and NONE of the stalls worked. You’d think this would show up on the Tesla Nav or something but nope. BARELY had enough charge to go 40+ miles away to the nearest supercharger.
"Do NOT use charger 4A. Max charge if 70 miles per hour charge. I sat for an hour and gained only 50 miles of range. I moved to 2A and it jumped to 250 miles of range. Very irritating. Also, this charger is in the middle of nowhere. Exits are tough to figure out, too.

I gave it 4-stars because it’s way, way better than running out of battery."
Do people really NOT understand that the power used to run these electric chargers comes from FOSSIL FUELS?  HAHAHAHAHA
"Docked one star because you do have to pay for parking. I paid $8.

I’m not sure why other reviews say charging was so slow for them. Mine has been around 270-300 mi/hr the whole time."
"Does anybody actually use these chargers? I've been driving past them for months --most of a year-- and have never seen any cars using them. None of the pictures in these reviews show any cars, either.

Saw an interesting article recently about Tesla chargers. California passed a law requiring that chargers display the cost of charging, along with other info you might expect on a gas pump. Tesla chargers have no such displays...yet. Not in CA, not here, either.

My limited experience with commercial chargers is that they tend to have pricing equivalent to the price of gasoline...even though the electric cost is far less. How do they get away with it? Well, they're aimed (especially these Tesla chargers) at transient vehicles, those who can't simply go home and plug it in (at a fraction of the cost). Captives. No wonder there is no display to tell you how much your ""fuel"" is costing!

Pretty, though. And plenty of space for your car!

2023 update: three years later, there are now cars using the chargers."
"Does exactly what you think it would, charge your Tesla believe it or not. All jokes aside, it charges ridiculously fast and only takes a few minutes to charge to the percent you want."
Does not actually reach anywhere near 250kW. Maybe 80?
"Does not exist anymore! The Tesla destination chargers were replaced with JuiceBar chargers that use AmpUp to charge you. They have J1772 plugs and charge at 10kW. The current rate is $3/hour plus taxes, fees, and idle fees ($5/hour starting 30 minutes after charging finishes). Max allowed charging time is 4 hours. Then you have to go unplug and plug back in to start a new session. The NEMA 14-50 and NEMA 5-20 (120v) outlets are still there if you have your UMC on you. The two times I used the 14-50 outlets, I had to turn on the circuit breakers in the breaker panel not too far away. There are three charger plugs and three outlets of each that reach four parking spaces, although a couple of spots were usually ICE’d. I recommend bringing your J1772 adapter if you plan to use the charger, and also bringing your Mobile Connector with a 14-50 adapter if you don’t feel like going through the trouble of dealing with AmpUp and needing to reconnect after 4 hours."
Does not exist! There are EV marked parking spaces and some remains of cables sticking out the concrete
Does not exist.
DOES NOT WORK - THANKS FOR NOTHING
Does not work! The handle looks broken with exposed wires. Useless.
Does the job
Doesn't exist
"Doesn't seem to work. Always under repair or some other funny business going on.

Just not worth it anymore trying to use this charging station."
Doesn't work
Doesn't work
"Doesn’t charge your Tesla at rated peak speed of 250kW, not even close to half of rated speeds, this is after preconditioning 20-30 miles before arriving at station. At best 75kW. This is the normal rate I have experienced at this station over the course of 2 months. Model 3 Dual Motor

Willing to change rating when issue is resolved."
Doesn’t exist
Doesn’t exist
Doesn’t work.
Dollar store is only available bathroom.  Off highway too far. Avoid if possible.
Don't bother. If not staying won't let you charge even offered to pay for a room and they said no with 2 open chargers. Not accommodating bordering on rude.
"Don't dip in before backing up, especially while driving fast. There's an ahole with a black tesla rental that does this nonsense. He dresses like an idiot too."
"Don't drive one - but this place is impressive.  The many super chargers are easily accessible,  and as we crawled by,  the ratio was 9 of every 10 were TESLA beauties.  A fun moment ."
"Don't go there, this is only for guests"
Don't go to the Tesla Casablanca charger location. The hotel owners are filling up the Tesla charging slots with ICE vehicles as parking spots. There are Tesla super charging spots in Niagara falls and Burlington.
Don't have a EV but the charger is located in the back.  Hopefully it's not iced and if so tell manager on duty.
"Don't have a tesla, but my dog seemed to enjoy peeing on it."
Don't have a tesla. Was at sheets getting a drink. Sheetz is awesome by the way. Never see anyone using those stupid charging machines...
Don't own an electric car but who knows..the tesla roadster is my favorite.  Just can't afford it .. this charging station look like a busy spot for tesla vehicles charging up..
"Don't pick the 1st stall!!!! It is not aligned with the parking spot. And since these cables are super short to begin with, it makes it hard to plug up. #notFun"
"Don’t come after dark. Hy-Vee is closed at 10p along with every other place on the strip. Unsafe for families and solo travelers.

Recently returned to a car covered in trash, and $1. Remorseful vandals I guess…"
"Don’t go at night when the store is closed. Wouldn’t consider it safe unless multiple people are there. When I stopped there was someone just waking around looking for things (1/2 smoked cigs, etc in the parking lot after I started charging. I made sure I had enough to get to the next town and got out of there."
"Don’t stop after 9pm. The Arby’s is closed. We had a van full of people park next to us in a Tesla spot and ask for money and food. And then another van parked in a different Tesla spot. Then a homeless appearing guy walked past the other side of the car. Obviously we didn’t charge for the full 20 mins we were supposed to. Moving on to Lake City, FL. Hope that one is better!"
Don’t waste your time go to the local Hilton hotel there’s a destination charger there.
Dorothy Lane Market: L2 48 amp Tesla chargers
"Dream charging station. 6 Charging points no waiting. No ICE vehicles in sight. Vending outside. Inside there's a Newhampshire general store and craft beer, Hand blown glass and local crafts from the League of Newhampshire craftsmen (I'm sure women have work there too), Highway diner,  Common man coffee shop and A djscount liquor store. A Merrimack bank and Live people in the information center, What a nice wayside stop!"
"DRIVE TO THE 2ND LEVEL OF GARAGE, DIRECTLY ABOVE THE NORMAL EV CHARGERS.  The GPS & the car itself kept taking us to the EV chargers that would not charge our Tesla, we finally realized after looking at photos that it is directly above.  We are not from the area, so we had no clue where to go.  Hopefully this will help others in the same predicament."
"Drive up, plug your Tesla in, it charges. Not much more to it than that"
Driving from PA to TX I took a nice little nap while it was charging.
"Drove by the Biden Welcome Center after paying at the Newark Toll Plaza along I-95. Found these 12 Tesla Superchargers between the service building and the Sunoco gas station. They also locate across the parking lots from the Starbucks drive-through building. The map address is 530 John F Kennedy Memorial Hwy, Newark, DE 19702-5427."
"Drove by today to charge and seven of the stalls were occupied by ICE cars. SEVEN. No spaces available to charge. Guess I’ll try back later and update.
Edit:  Went back the following morning ~8am.  There were about half the stalls available.  Charged with success and quickly."
"Due to the snow storm in buffalo’s the supercharger not working over 4days, we stay in hotels wait the technicians to recover it"
"Dunkin’ Donuts here and a Baskin Robins ice cream, but no real foods."
During daylight hours it is a decent stop. Bathrooms at Wendy's are passable. However please note we arrived early morning when Wendy's stated it was open but the dining area was not.
Each time we visited the charging station it most of the charging slots were available. Being inside the mall and having restrooms close by make it a great way to kill time and also to do some shopping.
Earlier review was not by me and should be ignored and removed.
Early morning stop to charge was perfect at these chargers. Not as many stalls as some other locations but having the Wawa right there made for an easy place to get a snack and the weather was perfect to sit out at there outside tables.
"Early Sunday morning, Very clean and safe.  All chargers appear to be working."
Easier to drive Tesla Yosemite. Right on Tenaya lodge
"Easily accessible from Highway, friendly staff at Hampton inn, various eateries and Walmart nearby."
Easily accessible off Highway 99. Located in a shopping center with restaurants and stores close by. Very clean and secure site with lots of chargers available. Berger IM which is very close by will let you order online and they will deliver to your car.
Easily accessible off highway and a variety of food options walkable. Felt like a safe area at night.
"Easily accessible, near lots of stores / food options."
Easily accessible. I was the only one there both times I stopped during my trip to Ocean City. In and out in 15 minutes so didn't bother exploring the nearby amenities.
Easily hit max speeds at 250kw with good healthy chargers. They have windshield cleaners here by the superchargers and you're right beside the Kum & Go.
"Easily our favorite Supercharger station, as long as the center is open. Spacious, clean bathrooms and water bottle refilling station inside. Picnic tables are a beautiful space to stop and eat lunch while waiting for your car to charge. Building blocks the noise from I84 and there is a beautiful dog park nearby as well (not walkable)."

"Easily walk to meijer gas station, but the chargers were slow both times I was there.  Once at 15% and 0nce at 5%"
Easy access
Easy access and all working.  Note: no chargers for trailers (I.e. chargers on sides of end spaces )
Easy access but if you go in the morning hours none of the restaurants are open in the parking lot as they all serve lunch and dinner only. You can go across the street after or nearby to raceway when done charging if you need to use the restroom in the morning or late night hours.
"Easy access from downtown Madison. 8 stalls, numbered 1A-1D and 2A-2D so assuming these are V3 superchargers. Throttled power during charging session, which is odd since I thought V3 superchargers didn't load share.

37 minutes of charging took MYP from 22% to 91% at $18.45 cost after taxes. Averages out to ~$0.36 per kWh assuming 75kWh usable. Charging stats below.

BP next door is shady - no price tags on anything so be prepared to spend $5 on a Gatorade.

15 min @ $0.23/min $3.45
11 min @ $0.47/min $5.17
8 min @ $0.76/min $6.08
3 min @ $1.25/min $3.75"
Easy access from highway after a handful of quick turns. Adjacent to a Courtyard Marriott and Starbucks. Fast charging.
"Easy access from highway. I think it is a great idea to put superchargers next to gas stations with good amenities. The gas station store is nice, good bakery and coffee."
"Easy access from the freeway. Target and In-N-Out are in the same parking lot, making it a great place to stop!"
"Easy access from the main street, back in charging, nearby stores and a Burger King."
Easy access location.
"Easy access of the 15 Freeway with a large number of chargers. Very lightly used as the Outlet Mall that it’s attached to doesn’t seem to have a lot of traffic.

Good for a quick top off but it’s in a very isolated area so might be best to plan to stay in the car while charging."
"Easy access off 75 and located next to a tourist welcome center with picnic tables and a grassy area for dogs.  Restaurants within walking distance are McDonalds, Cheddars and Shiloh Steakhouse.  12 chargers 🔌 as of 3/25/2023:  6 pull through and 6 back in"
Easy access off interstate. In the holiday inn parking lot next to a Starbucks and iHop. We stopped at Whataburger on the other side of the interstate before charging. Few options near by if you want to grab before getting to the charger.
"Easy access off of 285 with plenty of food options,  a grocery store and liquor store within a short distance. We did not think the routing options to get out of the area and back onto 285 was correct however.  Going back the way you came would have been easier than the circuitous route tesla told us to take."
"Easy access that is visible from the main road. Stalls are back in with no stalls turned 90° for pull through charging. It is possible to charge with a trailer or large bike rack if you pull in on the end, but it's not optimal."
Easy access to chargers. Also has ChargePoint chargers. Lots of resturants within walking distance
Easy access to the highway and a nice hotel and a couple of other restaurants within walking distance.
Easy access to Wendy's and plenty of stations. Have seen a couple ICE'd but yet to see more than one other car there charging with me.
"Easy access,  clean,  multiple stores for and restrooms nearby."
"Easy access, convenient to several stores and restaurants. Used this several times, only very busy once (Saturday afternoon)."
"Easy access, near Meijer and McCalisters Deli."
"Easy access, quick charge. Kum and go grounds, so all amenities that go with that."
"Easy access, quiet neighborhood. 3 min walk from shops. Very low use when we went in the am. No bathrooms nearby, so just be aware of that, you'll have to walk. Perfect stop just after or before the border crossing. Also has Flo/BC hydro chargers if you're needing chademo or CCS charging"
"Easy access, very fast, no garage payment issues as it is outside the store."
Easy access.  Code to enter garage can be found by tapping the Tesla Supercharger location on your navigation screen.  Enter this code (don’t forget the # at the end) to get into the gated garage and then again a few yards later for entry into the raising/lowering arms.  2nd floor.  Plenty of room in the garage (not a tight fit like some garages downtown nola).
Easy access.  Lots of chargers.  Everything worked well and quickly.
Easy access. Can see it becoming a bigger stop with its own food and rest area and with starlink WiFi
Easy access. Not crowded. Plenty to do while charging.
Easy and convenient super charging station. Everything for my Tesla worked like a charm. All connectors working just fine as well as a good location feeling comfortable while waiting for a charge.
Easy and convenient.  It's busy though.  Don't go at peak times
Easy and fast ! 👌🏽  always a good thing to be facing the gas prices when you charging your tesla lol
"Easy charge.  It charged at 150kw max for us which was about 50 minutes for a full charge on a Performance Model Y. Pilot has clean bathrooms, a friendly Subway inside and plenty of drink and snack options.  There is a Burger King nearby if that is more of your speed."
Easy charging station and it worked great. They really need to put some trash cans out by the chargers. Or even recycling bins for all the plastic bottle trash that are thrown out there.
"Easy fast not to frickin expensive. Watch out for the ""u have stayed too long"" fee. It is brutal by the minute!!!!"
"Easy find, are like 15 stations. Without parking payments."
Easy highway access location with walkable ameneities. Charged around 100 kW. Staff at Lodging adjacent to chargers were kind and allowed use of clean bathrooms.
"Easy in and out from the road way. These are also right next to Harris Teeter, which is a nice convenience. Great location for hitting some sights and shopping. All the stalls worked and had ample space to get in and out of the vehicle."
Easy in and out.  Decent Shell convenience store on sight.
Easy in and out. No wait
Easy in and out. No waiting.
Easy in easy out
"Easy in easy out
Note:can get real busy and may have to wait"
Easy in from the freeway.  Lots of restaurants within a short walk.  Friendly talkative people charging their amazing cars.
"Easy in, easy out.  Quiet corner of the shipping center."
Easy location to access.
Easy location to get in and out of.  It is a high use station so you may have a wait to get plugged in.  It is very close and convenient to places to eat and shop withing a three minute walk.
"Easy location to get to, at one of the local Sheetz locations. There are usually at least three available stations when I have visited. Easy in and easy out. Having an impeccably clean Sheetz right across the parking lot is a definite plus. Great options for food and beverages.

Charges at 90+ usually."
"Easy location, back off the Wawa lot. A good snack selection at this Wawa, with sandwiches, salads and even fresh guava juice.
Clean restrooms.
1 of the chargers was physically broken, as if someone drove into it."
"Easy location.
Park tight to the curb for the cable to reach.
Grab the free Trolly to explore the area."
Easy off the interstate. Comfort Inn has clean restrooms. The Nebraska Bar and Grill has outdoor dining and is pet friendly.
"Easy on - easy off from New York State Thruway Kingston exit 19. Clean bathrooms, ample parking, lots of food and drink options. Well lit, modern, open and well kept. Eight superchargers here with maximum output of 150 kW. Super fast charging took me from 10% to 85% in 20 minutes. Lots of gas pumps if you are traveling with ICE friends or RVs. The store employees are extremely friendly and they have a self-checkout for quick grab and go items. There is a full service deli here and a huge cappuccino bar with a great selection of flavors. The deli offers excellent Italian subs and other delicious creations. See photos."
"Easy on / off I-10, 240 Kw initial charge rate, located at Mobil station / minimart open 24 hours with drinks, snacks, bathrooms."
Easy on and off from I-75. Clean. In Wawa parking lot. Lots of charging stations and I was the only Tesla there.
Easy on and off. Sheetz 24/7 for goodies. AND trash can and windshield washer squeegee stand by the chargers. EXCELLENT!!
"Easy on n off exit. Many chargers available.  3 chains open including McDonald’s, Subway, Dunkin’ Donuts, & Qdoba. Perfect quick stop"
"Easy on/off freeway. Well lighted busy parking lot. Grocery store and InNOut next door. HUGE improvement over the Clay st., Ukiah location. Thank you!"
Easy parking. Sheetz nearby with friendly staff and a car wash.
"Easy peasy! Pull up, plug in, wait, and pull off! I love the location it is in the hotel parking lot behind TWO gas stations and a Wendy's. They have garbage cans and about 8 charging stations (maybe more!) I will use this location again."
Easy peasy.
Easy spot off the interstate to get to. Easy access parking area.
"Easy stop on my frequent drives between Colorado and Texas. Charging speeds are good, women's restroom in the grocery store has multiple stalls and has always been clean. Grocery store has a lot to offer and there are restaurants and a coffee shop in walking distance. Nice quiet neighborhood behind the grocery store where I walk the dogs while charging."
Easy to access — Wawa has got the right idea. Hopefully more gas stations will follow suite 🙌🏽 @ThatBlackModel3
Easy to access charging location right off the freeway. 250 kW speeds get you charged back up quickly. Tucked into a quiet corner of a commercial plaza with food options nearby.
Easy to access from the highway for charging but the Ruby Tuesday was closed so bathrooms were not easily accessible.
Easy to access location and plenty of food and restroom options in the parking lot. All chargers appeared to be working fine
Easy to access using Tesla's navigation system. 250 kw chargers are the best.
"Easy to access, close to Target and it always has open chargers."
"Easy to access, plenty of spaces, and a dog area and bucket of window washer fluid is available. Kind of an inconvenient walk to the rest area when snow plowed covered the sidewalks…"
"Easy to access, quick. Somewhat busy at noon on a Monday but I had no trouble getting a space."
"Easy to access, right next to a clean Love's travel stop. I work in Midland often so this stop is a must. Good charging speeds (141 almost every time). Well lit and open by the road so feels pretty safe."
Easy to find
Easy to find and a short drive to Dinkin Donuts that was open before 5 on a Sunday morning. Other than drinkers staggering out of Arch II sports bar it was pretty quiet.
Easy to find and access from the highway in a Dennys parking lot with several restaurants within walkable distance.
Easy to find and many places to enjoy while getting Supercharged
Easy to find and no waiting. This location seems very safe in parking lot of gas station. No photo but others posted here are accurate.
"Easy to find and use.
Very fast, almost too fast because I was having such a good conversation with my beautiful future wife.... hopefully."
Easy to find and use.  Good location
Easy to find and works great.
Easy to find at the edge of the ACME parking lot. Decent speeds. I was preconditioned and started charging at approximately 115 miles remaining and was getting speeds of around 110kw.
Easy to find from I75. If you stop here early morning restaurants will be closed. Must cross busy highway to access fast food chains for restrooms. 😕
"Easy to find in the parking lot of the home store, by the garden center area in the strip mall right off of the main road. It's also right across the smaller parking lot mall road from a satellite strip mall with a the Steak escape, and other fast food places. 6 Old school chargers that work fine but don't light up. Lucally they aren't blocked by anything but a curb and the building on one side so just follow Google maps for once it will take you directly there."
Easy to find right off 395 West on 1a. Behind Ruby Tuesday.
Easy to find right off the interstate. Close to a gas station for snacks or the bathroom. Lots of places nearby to eat before or after your charge. 250kw stalls so pretty fast charging on my model Y.
"Easy to find station, I’ve charged here multiple times and never had to wait for a stall. At nighttime, the area is well lit. I ran into Target to grab a few things while charging, which was really convenient."
Easy to find then other locations.
"Easy to find, clean and charging is very fast. There's a Wendy's if you need a quick bite also."
"Easy to find, clean, empty but charging at only 60 kW at a 250 kW rated stall. Dunkin restrooms closed for covid."
"Easy to find, convenient location at intersection of two highways with 24 hour convenience store on site."
"Easy to find, easy to park, and not crowded when I was there. There's a trash can with a windshield cleaner/squeegee, but the fluid container was dried out."
"Easy to find, however if you want a bite to eat, say at Panera, you’re forced to cross a large highway without a pedestrian crosswalk. It’s doable though, just cross at the point of the light cycle that you normally would. Be safe!"
"Easy to find, lots of open spots on a Saturday around 11am. Across the parking lot is a grocery store with clean bathrooms."
"Easy to find, plenty of space. Really fast."
"Easy to find, quaint car museum, nice people."
Easy to find.
"Easy to find. At a mall. We came at night which is inconvenient for food/bathrooms, but it is well lit and there’s a security vehicle driving around, so feels safe."
"Easy to find. Gas station Market is not too bad, and you don't have to wait very long for the charger."
Easy to find. Good charging speed.
Easy to find. Macy’s and California pizza kitchen are around the corner.
"Easy to find. Plenty of places to sneak a bathroom trip. Not as fast as we would like, but hey, it's sleepy hollow, what do you expect?"
Easy to find. Super cute town to walk around and shop or sit down to eat. Small space to throw a ball around.
Easy to get from highway.
"Easy to get spoiled with 250kw, great reason to stop into the old plaza again."
Easy to get to and finally college station has an open supercharger!
"Easy to get to and out of the way, so lower risk of getting ICEd. Fast charger got up to 250+kW. About 0.5miles from the hwy is less convenient than some stations. Bathrooms were clean and it's nice to have somewhere with A/C (or heat) to walk around in while waiting."
Easy to get to and plenty of stations.
"Easy to get to and the traffic is not bad. Your best food option is the Waffle House only a short walk. Get the ham, egg & cheese grits bowl while you wait."
Easy to get to off Interstate 55. Nicer part of town. Meijer just across the parking lot for food. Car wash next door.
Easy to get to plenty of spots
"Easy to get to, it is on the far left of the lodge plaza. Sadly, we had a few ICE vehicles blocking some spots, but there was only one other Tesla."
Easy to get to.
Easy to get to. Gas station was fine.
Easy to get to. Inside the parking ramp straight out from the grocery store
Easy to get to. Plenty of chargers available. Plenty of stores and restaurants nearby.
Easy to get to. Plenty of charging cabinets.
Easy to get to. Wasn’t too busy for a Sunday. Well lit place.
Easy to get to... shopping is right there...and plenty of parking! Agave Azul restaurant was a great spot to have lunch too...
"Easy to locate and hook up, and not busy. It's located in Mejier's parking lot so you can also use that facilities during open hours. Always fast and efficient."
Easy to locate and right next to the famous Black Bear Diner.
Easy to locate Supercharger right next to the Meijer gas station. Many options within walking distance.
"Easy to see from the main road. Plenty of space around it. Signage to discourage non eve users for more than 15 minutes. All stations appeared operational.

Right next to a typical Sheetz.

Pricing was better than it is back in MD."
"Easy to use, always faster than I expect."
Easy to use. Not busy
Easy walk to Target and Giant Eagle. TGIFridays 5 min across a parking lot. This supercharger is a little difficult to get in and out of.
"Easy well lit access in the Giant supermarket parking lot. Just be sure to ignore the directions to turn right at the light at 611 and instead, go the direct route by turning left on to 611 at the light. Chargers are located up by the main road, simple to see as you turn in. Super clean parking lot, great amenities within walking distance. Supercharger worked flawlessly."
"Easy-off, easy-on location. Reasonable high speed, long enough for a meal in one of the nearby restaurants. For a great sandwich try Philadelphia's about 200 yds down on the opposite side of the main drag. Best Western is well maintained and arranged around an attractive courtyard."
"Easy, clean, exactly what you'd expect. ~$20/full charge, 30 min charge time."
"EDIT (4/16/21):

Well, it’s been 2 weeks and I don’t see a noticeable difference in these chargers. Although, the two that use to not work at all appear to be operating at least. There were 6 vehicles here for one charge and I was getting 35kwh plugging in at 30%. I plugged in with two other vehicles at 20% and was getting 90kwh, and have gotten over 100kwh once when I was down to 10%. Overall, I expected to get over 100 anytime I was near 20% but that doesn’t appear to be the case, and by the time I’m up to 40-50% I’m down to around 40kwh. It’s only been between 40-50 degrees, so I know that can slow it, but with 15mins to precondition and a couple days in the 60’s I just don’t think it’s going to be much better. Maybe my expectations were just unrealistic from a couple other V3 chargers I’ve been to.

I can say up to 80% it is staying above 30kwh, which is better than I noticed previously.

EDIT (3/31/21):

They are upgrading these chargers!!! Thank you Tesla. Awesome!

Original:

This current location is in a great spot off 94 but really should be upgraded to faster charging."
"EDIT: be warned, if you walk your dogs while charging, the roadside behind the chargers is FULL of all kinds of trash; so be mindful of where they walk.

Decent supercharger mildly off the beaten path, so not as busy as most chargers in the area.

Only saw one person ICE-ing; which surprised me considering this is in the middle of big-boi-truck-country.  A little dimly lit and right at the entrance of the drive-thru, so watch your step if you walk inside at night; a disproportionate amount of drivers fly around the corner into the drive-thru."
"Edit: this is clearly out of date, but as a follow-up we told the cashier inside and she immediately went out to mark the charger as being out of order. Good response by the local business!  They get 5 stars.

Good location, but one of the chargers is out of order and with no sign attached there's no quick way to check without plugging in first. A simple sign would save time.  (BTW, it's the one you drive into nose first.)"
"Edited to add-
Now that COVID is dying down this coffee shop across the street is more open and WOW!! They have amazing coffee and the BEST scones ever. Definitely check it out!

Right off the interstate and has a trash can. Not much within a short walking distance to get food, drinks, etc, especially after hours. Seems like a safe enough location. Overall not one of my favorite chargers but gets the job done."
"Eh... Location could be better, some outlet mall with not much in it. Currently the 1st supercharger is broken. Very dark, the only light is the dim light of the Gap Factory Store sign 😑, so could be a security concern at night.

Also parking lot is busy & a little long to get in and out. Otherwise it does the job."
"Eight 150kW chargers, in the Wendy’s/ Shell gas station; also a 420 shop next door. Charging is not super fast, but at least one can use the restrooms at the gas station mini mart. The area can get super-windy."
"Eight chargers just to your right as you enter the outlet mall. Two sets of restrooms in the back left/right of the mall, grass for pets, Subway, Starbucks, various shops, shaded benches. Though it's close to the interstate, the access as you travel west is roundabout. There are also two, non-Tesla, EV chargers behind the ATM."
"Eight fast 150 kW chargers, including one pull-forward for those who don't like to back in. The convenience store is very nice, clean, and full-featured, and includes an Arby's."
Eight supercharger spaces plus four (two each) CHAdeMO and CCS
"Eight superchargers available in the back of the Holiday Inn parking lot. We used stall 2A and got 250+ mi/hr for a charge rate. Easy access from I-25. Restrooms in hotel. Not a lot of food/ drink offerings in the area, but understand it is TorC after all. Worked great.

8Jan2020 Stopped at my favorite Store Charger in TorC! Stall 4A have is a charger of 320 mi/hr for a bit. One other Tesla S sharing the chargers. Worked great."
Eight superchargers. Good place to let the dog out and charge. It’s in the same parking lot as Stonehaus Winery and there’s also an antique store.
"Eight units just off Great River Road (197) on Hannah Ave. NW. Easy to find, just look for the Shell station. All operational."
"Eight working Tesla super chargers, next to a large truck stop the Flying J and a Dennys restaurant. There is a large grassy area to walk your dog. Small dog park could benefit from a bit of shade and some maintenance. Otherwise nice Tesla stop."
Electric car is for rich people........how don't need them
Electrifying.
"Electronics Pkwy charging rate was awesome. Unfortunately, the nearby hotel/convention center is closed, so you have to walk to the Kinney Drugs to use the bathroom."
"Embassy Suites does not put any signage prohibiting non-electric vehicle parking at the destination charging spaces.  We called ahead to make sure we'd be able to charge after our 3-hour drive to College Station and were told they would put a cone out to protect the spot, but there were gas vehicles parked there and the hotel employees just shrugged and told us there was nothing they could do."
"Empty as expected at 6:30 am on a Sunday. Decent charge at 82 kw. Wawa open. Clean, safe."
Enjoyed this location has a mini mart and grocery store immediately nearby.
Enough super chargers.  Centrally located.
Entire service area is currently (Oct 2022) closed for construction
"Entrance/exit are only one way and it's very inconvenient.. Like pretty/very.
That being said, very nice supercharger itself, of course, and nice mart.
Make sure to check if there's a line. There's usually not but this one does get busy."
"Environmentally responsible individuals don't clean out their cars onto the ground. Please find a waste receptacle. Otherwise a convenience, and quite impressive when several different colored models all charge at once."
Equipment at destination charger not working.
EV friendly lodging. Very clean and well maintained facility. Two Tesla wall chargers and one charger for other EVs. Manager put cones out to prevent non EVs from parking in these spots. Highly recommend them for your next trip to Branson.
"EV Haven is permanently closed.  Sorry to see it leave,"
Eva is very warm and welcoming person. We are so grateful we could charge our Tesla here!
"Even at 11pm, it was 75% full.  Did not charge at fastest rate."
"Even If you are the only car , they cannot provide 150 kw all the time ."
"Even next to another car charging, got up to 160kW but used it during a road trip so it was hot enough to take that much juice. Hy-Vee restrooms are north side of the building near bakery (opposite side building from pharmacy). The chargers are located away from the store entrance making it likely to remain available. Clean restrooms."
Even though it's a 120 kW charging speed is good. Located right next to the Holiday Inn & The Mav Grill on Ryan's Road
"Even though most stalls are occupied, I'm getting over 200kwh at 11am on a Friday"
"Even though this appears as one of the 250 kW supercharging stations, it is not. Charging is very slow (at most got up to mid 80's kW) and there was only 1 other Tesla charging (who was parked 5 stalls away from me). It's in the parking lot of a restaurant, so you'll have plenty of time to eat while the car charges."
Even though this is an older 72 kW charger works amazing. Great shopping nearby.
"Every charger seemed to be in working order and charging fast! 9%-90% in 35 minutes! Worth skipping Grants Pass for a less expensive charge.
Great location right off the freeway.  Pulled in at 10pm and In 'n Out was open so we could grab a snack and use a bathroom!"
"Every time we go, it’s as slow as destination chargers. Is it broken, or do other reviewers not realize this is atypical?

Once again today I charged for a full hour and got about 70 miles. It cost 10 bucks for the privilege. This has not been my experience at any other supercharger"
"Every two stalls give max (150kw/hr)
Which means if there is a car next to you then you only receive max 75 kw/hr
Leave an empty stall between you and other Tesla if possible so you can receive 150kw/h
Try it out and see the difference."
"Everyone leaves there cars here, no one inside the cars and it’s full. Poor management"
"Everyone’s experience will vary here. My experience was just fine. I maxed out at 150. The area was a tad tricky to find but with fortune, I was able to find it easily. As other reviewers said, no restrooms to go to in the immediate charging area. I’m giving 5 stars for the charger doing what it was intended to do…charge at the expected rate."

Everything was working but this is only a 150kwh charger that is shared. Almost all spots were full at 8pm and only charged at half speed.
Everything went well.  Charger operating at full speed.
Everything worked exactly as expected.  Parking lot is nice and clean
Evidently 2 of 8 chargers are not functioning. I am number four in line and there is a line behind me. Very busy for a Sunday afternoon!
"Excelente! Great!
El mejor Tesla Supercharger
Landscaping, picnics tables with umbrellas, stingers for kids... nice grass, hotel n3x tonight looks really nice and country, pizza place... everything so far so good"
Excellent
Excellent
Excellent
Excellent
Excellent / we went to Win Dixie super Market within 15 minutes changed
Excellent 4 bay supercharger located at a Hampton Inn. Great place to overnight and charge your Tesla.
Excellent and well kept! Proud to be a Tesla driver sometimes!
"Excellent charger location. Got up to 250kW and was up to 50% in no time. Wendy's and a market across the parking lot. Very close to the highway and unlike many places, they have a place to put trash without hunting around or going inside. Well lit at night and the market seems to actually want EV drivers to visit rather than just share a parking lot."
"Excellent Chargers, getting 38 mph charge on my Tesla long range model Y."
"EXCELLENT chargers.
Gorgeous area. About 10min off hway.

2 fast working tesla chargers.
33mi/hr on MX.

Free. I'm assuming for hotel/restaurant.
100ft walk to entrance. (Blue car on left of pic is charger location)
Another j1772 charger seemed ok.

Mostly empty during my stay for few days."
"Excellent charging location, clean, grass for the dogs, nearby restaurants and shopping. Typically plenty of stalls open and very close to the highway."
Excellent charging speed reaching 330 m/hr.
Excellent charging station with regular and fast charging.
Excellent convenience! Our car tops up 40+ miles while we are having a great lunch. Cannot be better!
"Excellent like all Tesla superchargers I have visited.  Fast, always working and in decent locations."
Excellent location - 5 minute walk to many restaurants and shops. This fills a much needed supercharging gap that existed in the Finger Lakes region.
Excellent location - bathrooms are clean inside and chargers are right up against the building. BBQ restaurant inside the gas station is quick and the food is good - easy way to kill 20-30mins.
Excellent location and very friendly diamond store. They always wave to me when I go charge my Tesla.
"Excellent location behind the Wawa. Plenty of room to back in. These seem to be older chargers, my screen only showed 65-70 Kw as it charged."
Excellent location but charging power is subpar.   Max  KW reached was 52 and would take over 1 hr to fully charge.   I better than a home charger.   I hope this will be fixed because ideal location and Rhode Island does not support electric vehicles
Excellent location close to I-10 adjacent to an Outback and strip mall with other eating establishments. There is Walmart across the street. Chargers are fairly well lit.
"Excellent location for a supercharger very strategic. Just outside of sheets, charging speed is as expected for the advertised 150kW."
"Excellent location in a shopping complex. Relatively safe, but my MS was keyed here on the hood the second day I got it. Usage is high.

Note that the Safeway shopping carts lock well before you get to the car so shop lightly."
Excellent location in Meijer parking lot. Near Culvers and Starbucks. Also a Walmart Supercenter nearby.
Excellent location next to Sheetz (
Excellent location that was not busy at all when I was there.  Plenty of spaces to charge and there are a ton of amenities around to satisfy any needs.
Excellent location to charge Teslas. 12 bays and clean and safe parking lot. Smithfield Chicken and BBQ is very large with plenty of seating and clean and large bathroom. Helped us get to the beach and back on plenty of charge.
"Excellent location to charge up. Banks, pharmacy, restaurants, and a dispensary within walking distance. Your next charging stop is at Ozark with limited healthy eating options."
Excellent location with 3 chargers @ 32mi/hr. Clean and well-lid.
"Excellent location with lots of food and shopping options!  First charger I tried only produced 35kW, but switched to another and got 115kW.  Highly recommend if you need to do a long charge."
Excellent location with plenty of open stalls. Charging speed was pretty good for this area.
"Excellent location, 8 chargers, right behind Lynn's Dakotamart.  The grocery store is the best general stop in the small tourist town of Custer.  An excellent addition to the black hills supercharging."
"Excellent location, lots of chargers. Our charge, from 20% to almost 100%, was very fast. Grill and Hay J's Bistro open at 11 am; another restaurant opens at 3. We ate at the Bistro which has exceptional food."
"Excellent location, V3 Supercharger close to everything you need. Target, Panera, tons of other restaurants and shopping. This will definitely be our preferred stop when traveling through Atlanta.  Excellent install - love the superchargers that have parking on both sides and a pull through spot for when you are towing or have a bike rack, etc."
"Excellent location, very close to I-20.  Many food and bathroom options.  12 stalls and rarely crowded.  I highly recommend stopping here and skipping Birmingham if you can help it."
"Excellent location, with a Costco basket corral nearby!"
Excellent location!! While the car charges you can step into the Casey's general store to grab a bite or a drink! Only thing missing was a trashcan next to the charger.
"EXCELLENT location.
30sec off south GSP, prob about 1min off of northbound.

24hr Bodega with clean bathrooms and plenty of options about 150ft away, half the walk is covered by gas pump roof.

No trailer pull in stall. 😢"
Excellent location. All were in working order.
"Excellent location. Conveniently located right off an exit by a Starbucks and BP station. We did not go into the BP, but did walk in Starbucks. If you plan on getting anything there, I HIGHLY recommend putting in a mobile order ahead and walking in while you charge because this is a pretty busy area. Even as busy as it was, with a very long drive-thru line, we didn't have any trouble getting in or out."
Excellent location. Sheetz convenience store is just half a minute walk away.
"Excellent location. So glad this new location is open. So much more convenient than the only other Columbia location which was an older V2. Having the extra stalls and not having to worry about sharing at this V3 right off the interstate is so nice. And everything you need is close by - shopping, food, etc. Excellent install!!"
"Excellent location. The chargers are located in the parking garage (always open) across from the hotel. There are 4 Tesla destination chargers, one of them was not working. There is also a ChargePoint charger. The Tesla chargers are totally free, which is very nice. As you can see from the picture, it was charging my vehicle at a rate of 39 miles/hour, pretty good. Also, the nice thing about this location is, if you needed to charge for an hour or two, you could hang out in the nice, cool (or warm in winter) hotel lobby, with restrooms, etc. You could also walk to eating places nearby."
Excellent parking spot for my Ram 3500
Excellent place for a Supercharger! By the time you shop at Buc-Cees your car will be more than ready for your next stop. In fact we were able to skip our last usual Supercharger on the way home because we weren't able to get back to our car fast enough. Smart decision Buc-cees!!!
Excellent place to charge.   Convenient on the way to Dulles airport
"Excellent place to stop and charge at a great modern Sheetz. They even have showers at this Sheetz if you would need one on a long road trip. This is my regular stopping point between northern Virginia and Roanoke. I prefer this charger to the Strasburg, VA supercharger just a few miles north on I-81 although the Strasburg charger has nicer views."
Excellent placement! Congratulations to MGE for bringing the future to life.
"Excellent SC location supporting local and interstate traveller's with I-95 close by. Plenty of shade to enjoy while charging. Winn-Dixie Deli has a fresh selection of entrees, sandwiches, snacks and drinks to fuel up on."
Excellent service
"Excellent service !
It only lacks closed parking!"
"Excellent spot for a supercharger! Shops have wide sidewalks for strolling, benches for sitting, and many eateries (Panera Bread, Chipotle, Zoe's Kitchen, B. Good, and Lascala's Fire to name a few). I charge at the station twice a week and have yet to see more than three cars."
"Excellent spot to charge with V3 250kw speeds. Wish there were more options within walking distance. The Dunkin closes at 5pm, so plan to arrive earlier if you need to find a restroom."
"Excellent spot, v3.
20sec on/off route 17 SOUTHBOUND.
Going north is a headache abit.

Very close walkway through building tunnel to stores. Staples and pizza joint right there. Both have pee and pop. Closed at night. About 10second walk.

No trailer charger.

Hours of staples and pizza posted."
"Excellent stop! Got to 250kW immediately, near great travel stop and hwy exit. Much better choice than the Davenport supercharger by all measures. Travel stop has food court with lots of indoor seating, noodles of snack and beverage options as well as souvenirs and a small I-80 'museum'. Clean and ample restrooms. Largest travel stop in the world gives you lots of room to walk around and explore if you want to stretch your legs. Highly recommend this supercharger.

Wendy's, Caribou coffee/Einstein bagels, DQ/orange Julius, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell inside and Arby's across the street."
"Excellent Supercharger in Milford,Mitford, 16 stalls. My battery was still half full, but I wasn't going to arrive at my destination unless I charged, and my daughter wanted to stop driving so we recharged earlier than necessary. Electrons came down the wire promptly."
"EXCELLENT Supercharger that I will use repeatedly.  This is what it has going for it:
1.  RIGHT off of Route 50 - easy off easy on.
2, Right behind a Royal Farms with great restrooms and good food quick.
3. A dog park to help your pet out on long trips.

There are relatively few Superchargers on the Eastern Short and on Route 50 going to DC.  There reportedly is a fast charger in Easton but you have to go out of your way if you are heading for the DE beaches.
`"
Excellent supercharger!  Tons of tesla destination chargers as well. Next to a mall with plenty of options for food and restrooms.
Excellent supercharger. Charges Tesla quickly and has 10+ stalls so always an opening.
"Excellent view, but super extremely busy at times!
The geese are nice to view. Place is clean and is surrounded by stadiums."
Excellent. Fast chargers. Right off 91. 12 chargers. Also a Hydrogen station across the lot. Future Pride station in front.
Excellent. Super fast charge. Hidden by the side of the hotel. Good Mexican restaurant nextdoor.
"Excited to see more electric charge stations in town!  This is located next to Target and there's quite a few charging stations.  It's open and working, so disregard the review that states otherwise."
"Exit sign to get off the highway is easy to miss if not being actively directed. Supercharger is easy to get to.

Facilities are clean, well lit. Only Chick-fil-A was open during visit (1135)"
Expensive at 0.46/kWh and not too fast at 47kW. No squeegee either.  Bathrooms were clean. Odds and ends inside the gas station. Don’t bring the kids unless you want to buy a beanie baby…
Expensive but charges fast. Usually busy Tesla charging station. Alternate charging station is available at crossgates Mall.
"Expensive. Only charged 30mins but cost me $18,
From 30% to 70%"
Expresso & windshield cleaner available (most of the time).
"Extremely busy station. I had to wait to get a spot. As almost all stations were full at the time I charged, max was 100kw."
"Extremely busy, had to wait for 20 minutes for a spot. Lines are formed but hard for people to find the line. Charging area is really compact and busy (near the HEB exit)"
"Extremely convenient location, at a Sheetz (24 hour gas station/convenience store/made-to-order sandwiches and coffee drinks). This is one of two superchargers located on the western side of the Washington DC metropolitan area."
"Extremely difficult to access (you have to enter a parking garage through a “no entrance” gate) and there are only 2 stalls, only one of which was working. Unfortunately this is it for superchargers in San Juan so as Tesla owners we have no choice and are basically SOL."
Extremely fast charging. Busy but chargers free up quickly.
"Extremely slow charger. I have used it twice on a road trip. Both times we got no more than 60kW. With it being a popular charger, only having 6 stalls, and no other Supercharger for hours, it causes Teslas to stack up in wait. This is the worst charger I’ve run into.

However, there is a Sonic and an O’Charlies right next to it. Also, plenty of shopping nearby."
Extremely slow. Not a supercharger!!!
Extremely slow…The first stall was only 32kw. We tried another which started at around 150 then dropped to 64kw with only one other car there.
"Extremely slow.29 kW at 100mi/hr.
Who has that kind of time?"
"Fabulous supercharge service- just to comment on cost- it’s CHEAP! $6-$8 typically and the fee shows up instantly on my cell phone/credit card charge. Ted also commented that he never sees any cars there- (a waste?) but that’s probably because it takes only 10-15 minutes to charge up! A quickie: in and out. My greatest reservation about all-electric vehicles was “range anxiety” which Tesla has solved for! I can drive to the Adirondacks from southern CT with no problems... navigation plugs in any necessary stops for quick charge.
I love EVs⚡️🌿 it’s the future ☀️"
Fairfield By Marriott: 2 Tesla chargers & 1 other EV charger.  Located to left parking lot as you approach the Hotel.  Getting 34 M/hr at 40 amp on my Tesla MY.
Fairly easy access from the parkway and super convenient to get back into the parkway. Open and safe area for charging. The chargers are in the mall parking lot so there are plenty of shops and food options while charging.
Fairly easy off/on of I75 but do take notice when exiting I75-S. Else you'll quickly find yourself back up on the on ramp going north on 75. You'll have to walk a block to get to the closest fast food (Wendy's) if you don't pick up before charging. There is a grocery store in the parking lot.
"Fairly easy to get to from the freeway, for sure once you've been there once and know where it is. The parking lot is a bit tight. All 6 stalls are the pull-in style."
"Fairly isolated supercharger far away from major interstates highways. But it's nice to have one in an otherwise ""EV charging desert"" until more public DC fast charging stations are more widespread."
"Fairly new location for Tesla, located within the Iowa 80 truckstop (Claims to be the largest truckstop in the world). Prices slightly higher per KW compared to other charging stations we utilized on our trip from Denver to Davenport"
"Fantastic & a VERY CONVENIENT location!!  As with most Tesla superchargers stations, they’re primarily located on interstates & typically near next truckstops and small hotels.  For those traveling on “the 10/20,” this provides a good midpoint, particularly if you’re driving long distance. Of course, there are other MULTIPLE stations (plural) whether driving East or West: b/t Midland and Dallas, -OR- Midland and El Paso.  While I have certainly no complaints about this “standard 8 charging ports” station, the only “con“ that is applicable is that while road improvements are certainly a good thing, the city of Midland is currently doing extensive road construction at this intersection & for a very, very long time. The last few times I’ve been here, this relatively important intersection has been continually down to ‘ONE LANE’ in ALL directions so allow for a little more time going “to & fro.”  Additionally, it would be nice if TESLA had a station in Odessa on 20 as well but such has yet to be implemented.  However, a Tesla technician tell me, roughly 4 & 1/2 yrs ago - that Midland actually had this Tesla supercharger station installed ”early in” -  [even] B4 San Antonio ever had ONE (U can imagine the bureaucratic “red tape” involved in any EV installation) of these convenient stations due to many factors….so this speaks well of the city of Midlands willingness for innovation & growth!

Little Info:
“Very Versed” in EVs (I’ve been the owner of 4 EVs since 2013 - 2023; a decade).  IF U have ANY questions in regards such (driving an EV is different in regards to an ICE vehicle, please feel free to ASK.  I might note that I am still an ardent supporter of the Oil & Gas ⛽️ industry and there are subtleties U learn in the difference b/t EVs & ICE.  Equally, I am also an ardent supporter of EV vehicles, though I will echo Elon musk‘s comments in regard to such:

“If TESLA, today (2023), tried to support the ‘needs’ of all current transportation, it could handle about 1% or so of the nation’s transportation.”
- From an interview  sry late last year.

This is, very much, still, a technology in its infancy, that, & like all forms of transportation, since the horse and buggy, will continue to evolve, though I must admit, I don’t mind skipping my gas bill of MANY yrs ago (ESP since last “ICE” vehicle in 2012 was an SUV that ang’d approx 9mpg!).!  Anyway, like all technologies, things will evolve, and people still have  a lot of questions in regards to the EV industry and I’m only happy to answer such questions after a decade of owning/driving exclusively, EV…half of that decade, owning/driving exclusively multiple Teslas.

Also of NOTE: unfortunately, there are people who, dislike the EV industry, primarily out of fear and misinformation. It’s unfortunate as, in all of our lifetimes, ANYbody who is alive today, will ABSOLUTELY NOT be impacted by the EV industry as it pertains to their employment.  Those with this mindset might be wise to think 🤔 of the analogy of the original fear of automobiles when horse and buggies were the primary mode of transportation; “fear of [key word: VERY “EVENTUAL”…NOT “Overnight] CHANGE,” in essence, is what it boils down to.  Again, the EV industry will continue to grow, but for anybody alive today, it certainly will not, nay, CANNOT replace the ICE (Ice Internal Combustion engine) anytime soon; so PLEASE “put away such fears and prejudices; this industry will NEVER impact your livelihood!).  Moreover, such “haters” & naysayers should just relax, and understand that technology, no matter what industry it’s applicable to, will continue to evolve like ALL technology has since the dawn of time.  I could say much more in regards to this but as this is not the place for such discourse, those that do you have legitimate interests, again, feel free to contact me, and I am more than happy to enlighten anybody about the pros and cons of the fantastic “EV World” and help you to understand the differences as they definitely DO exist. Good day & blessings to all!  Take good care! ✌🏼🙂"
"Fantastic area for a charging station. Enter through the P2 entrance and it's to the immediate right.   I agree there should be signage when u pull in and throughout the garage it would really help.
Other than that it's a short walk to tons of shopping, bars and restaurants. Beware the idle fees though, this is a busy station and they don't mess around. Leave your car on the charger and it will cost you. Plus side is parking is free under 2 hours."
"Fantastic charger, never packed and charges up to 300 miles per hour of range."
fantastic fast charging. Near to stores..always available chargers..
"Fantastic location for a supercharger in western Arkansas, just off of interstate 40. There is a huge gas station right next to it with a large selection of food, coffee, snacks. The Tesla superchargers are in great condition, and as always, the fellow Tesla owners are kind and courteous."
"Fantastic location, the Busy Bee truck stop nearby had everything you could possibly need"
"Fantastic location. It's also very convenient to stop here no matter the time of day you're traveling...it is in the parking lot of a getGo that is open 24 hours. There are plenty of walkable food options nearby as well: Starbucks, Denny's, Chipotle, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, Burger King, and Chicago's Pizza. I wish all Superchargers were this amazing."
Fantastic so grateful I bought a Tesla superchargers still remain the best charging system.
Fargo ND Supercharging station is OUT OF ORDER and 6 of 8 stations are wrapped in yellow caution tape. 2 stations that don't have tape around them have NO power. Boo!
"Farther off I-10 than most superchargers so not the most convenient for roadtrips. Also, I don’t recommend going here at night. Has this eerily quiet and creepy feeling. Random cars kept pulling into the gym parking lot even though the gym was closed and the people never got out of their car. If you can make it to Crestview, that one is way better."
Fast
"Fast (speeds up to 250kW).
Stalls readily available."
Fast & efficient
"Fast 250 kW chargers, close to the highway. In a Wawa parking lot convenient for food and bathrooms. Some other food options down the road."
"Fast 250Kw charger and it was super cheap, only $0.35 at the time of our charging. It was in a parking lot of Sheetz, which had a restaurant inside (to go only). Nice to know it’s by amenities like restrooms and food."
"Fast 250kw chargers that are some of the least expensive I've seen. Today the price was 0.19/kw. Love those small town prices. Walmart, other retail, food, and c-stores just a few steps away."
"Fast 250kW chargers, 16 total. Very nice upgrade from the temporary slow 72kW chargers. Clean bathrooms right next door inside the dino travel plaza."
Fast 250KW supercharger. Kum and Go gas station and Subway are right there. Convenient easy on and off from Interstate.
Fast and clean
Fast and clean. Nice restroom. BBQ across street.
Fast and close to home.  They should add 6 more.
Fast and convenient
"Fast and convenient.   Charge your Telsa and grab some MTO food.  By the time I got my food, my Tesla was ready to go!"
Fast and convenient. Winn-Dixie to take care of your grocery and bathroom needs. Many restaurants in easy walking distance. Go Tigers!
"Fast and easy, it’s right when you enter the parking lot, can’t miss it. 4 stars because:
a. There was a lot of trash there. Like a lot, like an entire McDonald’s value meal just spread over two stalls, and
b. Someone took out the charger on a couple stalls and just left it hanging on the ground.
Had to walk the dog while the car charged, and it was kinda hard with all that trash."
Fast and easy!! In my way to Austin HEB in Shertz
Fast and easy. My hands are free from petrol.
Fast and free! Thank you!!
Fast and koo
"fast and moderately convenient. There are options in the area, you are not stranded if you need food or bathroom. If you like teenagers with loud mufflers driving in circles around town you are going to love this place. And it is near a store that only sells batteries."
Fast and next to a grocery store with a bathroom. Plenty of fast food around if you feel like poisoning yourself. For best results park between the lines just like a regular parking space{pet peeve here}.
Fast and not too busy around 11AM. Most users try to space out from each other.
Fast and plenty charger to connect
"Fast and reliable, bathroom of the hotel is clean and accessible"
Fast and super easy! Nice location
Fast changing working great 25 minutes and I was fully charged and ready for the road yayyy 😁
Fast charge and a sheetz !
"Fast charge and can accomplish so much while my car is charging! TJ Maxx, Lowes, Starbucks, and this excellent fresh Mexican restaurant right behind the chargers."
Fast charge behind station. Coffee is steps  away
"Fast charge with fast food, Burger King, etc.

Someone complained about northbound which makes no sense as there is easy access from both directions."
Fast charge with no wait. Great holiday lights too.
"Fast charge, convenient, and out of the way so no one is parking in the spots. Plenty of space for dogs to take a walk. A little run down/dated but there are food and drinks available."
"Fast charge, went in to WaWa to use the bathroom. Place is clean. Can grab something to eat or drink. Super chargers are behind the Wawa store."
"Fast charge.  Parking lot of subway, clean bathrooms."
Fast charge. A little bit off the main road. Near the Boscov's Dept. Store that has good prices and good deals.
Fast charge. Clean parking. Good location.
Fast charge. Good location if you are on your way to OBX
Fast charge. Only one there
Fast charger 20 minutes for 250 miles
"Fast charger and not too crowded.  1B is bad, avoid to use this station.  Hope someone read this review & fix it or place a sign so people know, especially on rainy day.
Make sure you drive to the back Hilton Hotel, there only 3 slow chargers you can see from street but there 10 superchargers in the back."

"Fast charger if you can get a spot, most of them are taken by non-ev’s. So, you may have to wait for a Bentley or a Mercedes to move.

Update:  They have added signs and a phone number to report (attached)."
Fast charger in a nice shopping center and near a nice rrsidential area for walking
"Fast charger with multiple charging positions. It's usually full, but we don't have to wait in line. Could have some trees around."
"Fast charger with plenty of stalls and conveniently located. If you have time, walk over to the OP Bar & Grille for a local, fresh homemade dinner. It’s worth the time."
"Fast Charger, but the restrooms at the Wawa Station are horrible. So dirty. Also, the store isn't clean as well.

The charger is high frequency, so it charges only 80%. I was there around 2 pm on the weekend."
"Fast charger, easy access from the highway.
The best thing about this location is that it’s near Pacific Rim/Cravings,  where they have awesome noodles/ramen/Asian food and boba.
Only thing is I wish all these supercharger stations would have trash bins so people don’t leave rubbish everywhere."
"Fast charger, not crowded at all, good charge speeds through out.
It is in the parking lot of a outlet mall, so there are stores and bathrooms decently close by. Also lots of trash cans on the sidewalk in front of stores, but none at the chargers themselves. We didn't eat there, bit not a lot of walking distance options. There is however a food court at the outlets that is close. We did not go in, but one of the workers told us it had good options."
"Fast charger, not the nicest area. It's in the parking lot of a Hitchcock's Food & Pharmacy with a hidden bathroom. Much easier to walk over to the Taco Bell to use theirs. The trash bins look like they haven't been emptied in a week."
"Fast charger.

Tough to get to a bathroom, as once the sidewalks are rolled up the public park, at the north end of town is IT.

McDonald's is still. Closing their dining room at 7 PM.
Carl's Jr is generously open until Midnight, right next to the park.

Sign on the bungalows next to the charging station, scolding Tesla Charger Customers not to leave human excitement on their campus.

May be time to install Chem Toilets at this site."
"Fast charger. Located in the Hard Rock Casino parking lot. Offers free shuttle to the casino, though there aren’t other walkable amenities. During the day you could walk to the golf course pro shop for food/drinks. There are two rows of pull-through chargers. The reason I rated this 4 stars is because there is a very loud speaker from the casino above the chargers blasting rock music, which makes it difficult to rest between stops."
Fast charger. Target was just steps away. Used restrooms in target and got a starbucks while charging at this station. If charging after hours not sure where you would be able to find restrooms tho
"Fast charger. Walkable to a nice and clean gas station, and in a hotel parking lot."
Fast chargers always empty
"Fast chargers close to a couple steak houses and several hotels.   Not close to much else from a walking standpoint.  Plenty of grassy areas and room to let you pup stretch their legs.  Chargers were filling up by the time I left but I don't believe there was any wait time.

Very slow not sure what the deal is recently but these chargers are way slower than previously."
"Fast chargers, good coffee, food available 24/7 bathrooms, easy enter access"
"Fast chargers. We suggest Jolts for treats. We were disappointed with the taco place and KFC… but Jolts is fun, with nice staff, and good treats."
Fast charging @250 kW.  It's located at a BP. Bathrooms are clean enough. I wouldn't skip this supercharger based on the reviews of the actual BP.  Arby's is attached to the BP.  Starbucks also in the same parking lot but we didn't go into it. Plenty of other Teslas charging during the two times we charged here.
Fast charging and a great location!
"Fast charging and always availability. Right off the interstate. The Quick Pik has been recently remodeled and has new owners. The bathrooms are usually clean and there are normal convenience store items as well as a sit down restaurant which also features Godfather's Pizza. Haven't had a chance to eat here since Covid-19 hit, but when they were located across the street the food was decent and kinda like an old style diner. One of the cool things about this location is there is a park right next to the Superchargers where you can walk, sit and relax or have a picnic. There are several benches and a gazebo to get out of the sun. Grab a few sandwiches and drinks inside and head out to the park for a picnic among the flowers with a great view of the Iowa countryside!"
Fast charging and at a flat rate all day. Was able to grab some juice in amazing time and after a couple minutes stretching the legs I was back to enjoying the drive.
Fast charging and convenient for snacks and bathrooms at Sheetz.
Fast charging and great location near  a Walmart grocery and Sheetz with well made specialty coffees.
"Fast charging and is walking distance from a lot of different places like Target, a bank some restaurants and a grocery store. Very good"
"Fast charging and love the variety of options to walk to; Five Guys, Applebees, Panera, Walgreens"
"Fast charging and not too busy area. It’s behind taco bell so you can’t see it from the main road.
It’s a bit spooky late at night if you go when the restaurant is closed."
Fast charging and plenty of spots.
Fast charging at 250kW but unfortunately you have to be in the toll road to use it. No local road access I could see.
"Fast charging at Wawa, YES please!"
"Fast charging but not alot around the charger.  It is at a hotel, so you can go in to use restrooms.  No food at the hotel though.  You have to run across a pretty busy road (no cross walk) to get to a subway or dairy queen.  It was fine, but not my favorite stopping place in our road trip."
Fast charging but often blocked by regular cars.
"Fast charging despite being half full of cars. In a parking lot with a grocery store, pizza place, and coffee spot. We were there during the day and it was a great experience."
Fast charging even fully occupied. Easy in and out restroom at the grocery store. I think it's a discount grocery store. First time ever I see a waiting line for men's restroom while no one's in the lady's. They're all from Tesla charging station btw. The restroom has 1 stall each. The lady's stall is clean and has toilet seat liner. There's a trash can near the entrance which I'm thankful for.
Fast charging located at a Sheetz.
"Fast charging plus I haven’t had to wait for a spot, nice location with places to eat, shop, or shoot with C2 Tactical Gun Range there."
"Fast charging station for Tesla in Tucson. It’s located close to many retail stores, including restaurants, supermarket, and service stores"
Fast charging with a fenced in dog run. Dairy Queen nearby too.
"fast charging, all stalls were open on Monday late morning.  I got up to 605 mi/hr on the model 3"
"Fast charging, and whenever I went there (evening) there was no one else charging."
"Fast charging, brick oven pizza and cafe. Also convenience store items if you just want a snack and my daughter liked her milkshake."
"Fast charging, but very busy spot and there is no charging etiquette! 5 spots open next to me and the guy used the one right next to me, My charge went from 81 to 49 kw so I had to move."
"Fast charging, convenient location but on the outskirts of the parking lot to discourage ICE vehicles from parking in the spots. The Hy-Vee across the parking lot has a lot of options for drinks, snacks, meals or some grocery shopping while you charge."
"Fast Charging, Great Location!"
"Fast charging, not busy at all, close to Walmart and a nice little boutique bakery/ice cream shop. I arrived middle of day on a Saturday and there was one car. Station is right next to the Walmart grocery entrance for snacks and bathroom. Good experience overall."
"Fast charging, plenty of food and restrooms while you wait."
"Fast charging, right near a gas station.  If you want to walk a bit further you can cross on a sidewalk over the highway to a decent sized mall for more food options.  Great place to stop and charge."
"Fast charging, safe location, shopping center at location, what more can you ask for?"
"Fast charging, Wawa is clean and great location to shop while charging. You have a great plaza to visit while wait to charge"
Fast charging!
Fast charging!! works great!! And best part is my husband works on them. I Always get to the next destination with no problem.
Fast charging.  Plenty of chargers available.  Within easy walking distance of a nice Hy-Vee grocery store and a McDonald's.  Great place to stop and charge.
"Fast charging. Behind Wawa. Aldi’s, Panera, Chili’s and Chick-a-fil close by."
"Fast charging. Bucees is like a Wawa or Sheetz on steroids.  A great spot for coffee, food and trinket shopping.  Cost me about 17.70 for 200 miles of go juice"
Fast charging. In back of Meijer parking lot. Bathroom in Meijer is completely on other side of building past produce. (Look for brick wall that says Market.) There are restaurants around but not really convenient walking distance from charging station.
Fast charging. Just a little hard to see where to back in the way the lines are painted. But if it prevents people from parking there that works for me.
Fast charging(250kw) bathrooms and trash receptacles. What more do you need? Well if it is winter and you are headed to OKC you will need to charge somewhere else in addition. Friendly chatty folks here
"Fast clean, in the parking lot of a good working mall, only thing is that it's a huge parking lot and you will be at the end.  Bring an umbrella"
Fast efficient
Fast electrons for the win! Hit 251kw!
Fast enough @150kW. Location sux but watcha gonna do…?
"Fast enough charger walking distance to In and Out, 24hr WinCo, Chick Fil A, as well as many other restaurants and retail stores. Only reason I'm giving 4 and not 5 stars is because I went late night/early morning and there were quite a few drunk/sketchy people out around the parking lot. It's a big lot so a lot of people were speeding, or driving unsafely in the lot."
Fast fast charge. In lowes foods parking lot. Everything close and clean neighborhood
"Fast kw charge with few vehicles on a Friday afternoon, right off the interstate, clean, safe, and nearby restrooms and mall."
"Fast reliable 250kw chargers and the travel plaza has food and clean bathrooms, another easy breezy charging experience. The plaza also has chargers for non Tesla cars, a truck stop and gas of course."
"Fast super chargers and great little store with everything you might need last minute. They are the highest priced chargers around, but are open 24/7 and I’ve never had to wait for a space to open up. Chargers are maintained very well and it’s a safe, well lit area for charging at night safely."
"Fast superchargers, but no other amenities once the gas station closes. I saw a police presence before turning in to the station, but it was dark and felt isolated while stopped there."
"Fast superchargers, got a full charge on my long range in 30 minutes. Rest area has chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Sbarro and Auntie Anne’s."
"Fast Tesla Supercharger for road trips! Great location behind Buc-ee's!  Place is clean and in great condition, 10/10!!!"
Fast V3 superchargers within Eldorado’s fenced parking lot which must be accessed by driving through their parking garage but no signs indicate this. They also have the slower Tesla destination chargers with which you can park at & charge all night (I think for free) inside the garage. Toilets and other amenities are across the street from the superchargers inside the casino.
Fast with ample spots open
"Fast, 250kw and in a nice Wawa!
Some of the stalls wouldn’t work"
"Fast, clean, and convenient. The river on property was a nice place to relax 🏖🦦🏞

Tip: Go to the hotel lobby to activate charging."
"Fast, clean, and efficient. Primarily talking about Tesla's, but this place was pretty good too. No real amenities, but there's a grocery store nearby, that is pretty much everything you need. It's one of those off to the side kind of places, so you're going to need to wander around the grocery store for a few minutes before your car is topped off."
"Fast, efficient, safe.  Close to fast food (Burger King & McDonald's), close walking distance to wonderful Chinese buffet and Meijer grocery store.  Very convenient access to nearby mall."
"Fast, friendly and convenient.  We topped our car up here before heading into the backcountry for five days.  There's both a Tesla and a J1772 charger here and the staff were courteous and super accommodating.  No idea what's up with the negative reviews - my wife and I felt super lucky and appreciative to have businesses around like these who share their infrastructure and make EV travel seamless.  Note that these chargers are primarily for those staying at the Bronze Antler B&B, so if you're planning a trip this way and want to charge, call ahead to make sure it will be free for you (they take reservations :) )"
"Fast, good location, clean."
"Fast, good location. Some pull in spots which is always appreciated if you have a trailer or bikes, etc. in your hitch. Chargers are meant to be pulled into from both sides, so pay attention to the signage which indicates which side to use for which charger. Some good food and a cool cafe right nearby."
"Fast, inexpensive charging. Plenty of chargers and easy to find"
"Fast, lots of chargers that don’t share power unlike older ones where they charge slower the more crowded it gets. This will definitely be a preferred charging stop for me from now on (maps usually routes me thru Ann Arbor). Also there is Meijers nearby for snacks and restrooms."
"Fast, well maintained chargers. There’s also a trailer pull-up charging area. The only downside is that the casino isn’t the best charging stop for picking up snacks on a road trip."
Fast!
Fast!!! While shopping my car was fully charged under 1 hour
Fast. Decently located. Ingles opposite has a Starbucks and there’s a McDonald’s (should you like that sort of thing) & Waffle House.
"Faster 250kWh charger. Good food options nearby. Backing in was a little bit of a pain since the chargers are right near the entrance/exit of the shopping center. A little expensive so check the cost ahead of time. Only one truck Icing a spot still able to find an open charger. If you are heading back to Denver, you don't need much charge as it's mostly downhill and you get a lot of regen."
"Faster than many superchargers. Kind of hidden. When gps says turn, turn. You'll see it near another business."
Faster than most chargers around the area but the maximum charge rate is only 110kw around and it decreases with number of vehicles charging at a time.
Fastest charger 250kv +
"Fastest charger I have seen over 250kw. We started at over 1000mi/hr charge with 80 miles on our battery at the time. model 3

Sheetz is the only place in the area though.

4 numb nuts were sitting in the station w pickups though. Local culture? Who knows."
Fastest charger in the area. Clean rooms and food is great. Best place to stay in bandera.
"Fastest charger out there. J1772, Tesla, and 14-50."
"Fastest superchargers between Green Bay, Madison, and Milwaukee!"
"Feels safe, always clean, theres a big field right next to it so you dog or kid can run around."
"Fence in parking garage. 188kW charging rate, appx. 730 Mi/hrs. When started at "
Fenced off.  Not here.
"Few issues, it’s not super charger except the name, takes about an hour to be fully charged the battery. There’s no bathroom by the charging station."
"Finally a good location on this side of San Antonio. Only one of car here but only managed 58kw charging.
Good amenities here. HEB Plus, Valero, McDonald's, and Taco Cabana, Bill Miller's across the street.
Easy on and off highway."
"Finally a smart supercharger setting!

We are traveling cross-country from Florida to Washington and back and NONE of the superchargers visited every 100 miles were easy to pull in without unplugging the camper. This is simply smart! Thank you!"
"Finally a supercharger in Peoria!! Took them forever!! Great super charger, fast speeds. Hyvee is great, wish they had them in the Chicago suburbs."
Finally a Supercharger in the Dells! This one is located behind Culver's. Easy access and many food choices near. Getting 120kW
Finally a supercharger UP!
Finally a Tesla Supercharger in PCB! 8 new stalls which were all open both times we visited. The convenience store located next to the chargers is extremely clean and has a great selection of refreshments.
FINALLY an EV charger near me. And all the people i assume read my reviews
Finally nice to have a Tesla charger in Huntsville. It is located between Trader Joe and Whalburger. Not the fastest charger and they cap it at 80% of charging capacity. Place is busy.
Finally open after nearly 6 months of waiting...spots are busy with non Tesla's but that is to be expected as this becomes the new norm of the station finally getting use.  People are usually in and out quick from Wawa anyway. 8 250kw stations.
Finally Tesla superchargers but this is the only place in laredo:/
"Finally,  a Supercharger on the Turnpike! 8 stalls, all empty at the time of charging. The service plaza has restrooms, Starbucks and Roy Rogers, where you can get a decent fish sandwich."
"Finally! Gainesville Supercharger is up and running.  Located just behind Starbucks and Chili's.   Also Whole foods right next to this location as well.

First night open and 1st charge for the location. 🤗"
Finally!!!!!!!
"Finally… a good sized supercharger on this side of town. 16 bays, too !  Great location for stores & various eateries."
Fine charger. I’ve stopped here twice. No issues. There’s only two bays. If both are used then charging rate drops. Worse case hop over to the northbound side rest stop and there’s more there
"Fine during the day. We snuck into the hotel bathrooms with no problem. However, I would not enjoy this stop at night. It's tucked away in the back with not much nearby."
Fine place to charge but isn’t a super charger (my bad for assuming). A bit far from anything so unless you’re staying there it doesn’t make much sense to leave your car. May as well charge at the spot by the plaza.
"Fire ants. Nothing open within safe walking distance before 0900 hrs.

Dunkin is drive through only."
First car that I've seen plugged in here. Not sure how busy it will be but I suppose it's a good service for those who can take advantage of it. Owners seem to be very happy with it.
First charge on arrival to brownsville we used stall 2c and it charged fast (120kw+). On departure we used stall 2d and it was very slow (50kw). No one was at charger either time.
"First charger didn't work, 2nd was slow until other car left, then super fast, 45 min done in 20."
"First floor of the Marriott parking garage. It is extremely expensive to park in this garage unless you are a hotel guest. Unless you have no other choices, look elsewhere."
"First Impression was this was a decent looking area.Appeared new and we were the only ones charging the entire time we were there.The stop has a small play area more suitable for small children toddler aged.Went inside to grab a quick lunch & use the bathrooms.The stop has two places to eat. Wendy’s and a BBQ place. BBQ line was long but smelled really good as well as looked good.We grabbed Wendy’s for the kids.Food & service was good.The inside was large,clean,& organized.Two separate bathroom areas which were nice. I think one had showers.The women’s bathroom we used could use some servicing since one of the soap dispensers was empty.The bathroom had a bit of a Bucky’s stop feel if you’ve ever been to one of those.Charging was fast since these were 250kwh & no one was there. Would look forward to stopping here again."
First long distance charge with our Model Y - imagine our panic as we pulled up with cones cordoning off most of the chargers…no idea why?? Fortunately 2 at the end were reachable…
"First road trip in the Tesla from Tampa to New Orleans. This was hands down our favorite stop (#1 of 4). Wawa had nice facilities for toilets, picnic tables, and plenty of snack/ eating options around."
"First super charging experience.  1A was not working, multiple times it says charging but then not charging.  Then moved to the 1B. Worked like a charm.  Same thing happened to another Tesla who came after me. Fortunately for them I was able to tell them, it was not their car, but the charger. They should have put a notice informing the malfunction.  Other than that it is a good safe environment."
"First supercharger experience and it couldn't have been better or easier. These are only V2 and I cannot imagine what V3 are like.

The Holiday Inn provides great travel facilities and good, though we prefer stopping in town and getting something to go."
"First time at this supercharger station since i'm a new Model Y owner, I have read that more and more stations have tesla wifi for software updates, and ""tesla service"" showed up when i searched for wifi, but i was unable to connect. I called Tesla and the guy said wifi wasn't available at this station, so... why was the tesla service network showing up on my screen..?
Still, charging was fast even though i only preconditioned for 15 minutes on the way there."
First time charging my Tesla here had to ask the guy next to me what to do I live in the area so this is a good place to charge your vehicle safe and easy there's a grocery store and a couple restaurants in the center so you can leave your car while it's charging and go eat or grocery shopping if needed.
"First time charging. Clean, safe facility. Charging speed never got over 70kwh. I hope the speed of charging will be faster in the future."
First time experiencing supercharger was great 👍 first 20 min then it dropped to 72kw everything was slow. I didn’t have trip planned. I when there for the experience.
"First time filling the family spaceship. Super convenient, super chill, super charged! 👌 Totally beats sitting at a stinky greasy gas station, coming away with no money and gas all-over your clothes and hands. And lemme see uh 18-22 dollars to getcha 250mls, or 60 to get you 300. Numbers don't lie earthlings. Don't believe me, go juice it up and see for yourself!"
First time I have seen a pull-through supercharger for vehicles with trailers. Love it and hope to see more of these!
"First time to visit this establishment,but it won't be my last. Very welcoming host and hostess. Bartender very knowledgeable about the wines and he was friendly but stayed on the job
Clean and well arranged. Great variety of Italian foods."
First time using a supercharger car said was 150kw but only charged at 64kw wish I had waited one more exit for Daytona that one says it’s 250kw. Only needed to put a-little in forgot to plug in the night before but would use again in a pinch
First time using a Tesla supercharger for our Model Y and it was so easy and fast! Took 20 minutes to charge from 20% to 80%! Lots of stuff to do around the charger too.
"First time utilizing this SC location and it was great - very chill and easy to get in and out. And I love that if you're just there to charge, you don't have to pay the parking garage rate so long as you're out before 2 hrs (new supercharger in Decatur is not as generous). I was charged up in 35 min and I will never not be happy seeing how little you pay vs. gas.

Tesla navigation is accurate, led me right to P2 level. After you take your ticket, make the first right at the stop and you'll see a small red Tesla sign on a pillar to your left. Keep going straight and you can't miss all the stalls. Happy charging~"
"First time we've seen windshield cleaner at a Tesla station. At 8:30 am on a Tuesday, we were the only ones charging. Yesterday the site was reported temporarily unavailable. Concerning for the Dallas to Amarillo trip."
"First trip here I got 100kw in the middle of the night 11:30pm Friday with no cars around, but during the day only got 24kw around noon. Outside temp was 40degrees F and only 2 other cars charging few stalls away"
"First was VERY hard to fund the charger. THEN, I could not even get the charger to plug into my vehicle! Had to go to a shop to get my vehicle charged. Worst experience ever!"
"First, don't go to the map marker in the Tesla navigation map.  The marker in Google Maps is placed correctly.

Look directly across the street from the marina parking lot and you'll see a warehouse with an open ""automated"" gate. Drive through the gate and on the right is an open shed with a sign that says ""Golf Cart Rentals"". On the opposite side and adjacent to the shed is an open Tesla charger."
"Fives stars for the combination of 8 supercharger stalls, lots of shops/food options and a bathroom that is open late (walk to the movie theater and keep going past the ticket booth and it will be around the corner to your left)."
Flooded. Bathrooms were nice though!
Follow google. Tesla map will leave you 100 ft away from the chargers. They are tucked in behind Taco Bell. Three fast food nearby. Two motels nearby too. Very fast charging at 400 kw in the beginning. 2 min from highway 75 exit.
Follow the pathway around the lake on the left as you face it and you’ll find a kids play area and public restrooms. We arrived during the local farmers market. Nice charger to take a break with young kids!
Food and ev charging!!
"Food options: cracker barrel, McDonald's, Applebee's, gas station. Several hotels in easy reach. Found one broken supercharger. Aside from that - great."
"Food was great, and charging was available every time we went there."
"Food, bathrooms, coffee. Great spot"
"Food, rest and fill"
For
For a newer gas station this place has gone down hill. Convenient on our trips. Bathrooms are gross and no soap and parking lot not well maintained. As dirty as the place is I wouldn't eat anything from the restaurant.
"For all the electric cars you would think others would follow this concept,first time I have seen it set up at a gas station which is the perfect place right.."
For customers only during business hours.
"For hotel guest, one Tesla destination charger & one Clipper Creek"
"For me, this was a five star, had a very nice lounge at the Courtyard that one can wait, and has a very nice bathroom, and grocery stores and nearby restaurants. I was here mid morning on a weekday and had no charging issues. One goes up entrance road to the courtyard and takes the first left. There is a little sign that says Tesla with an arrow. See pictures."
"For some reason the charging is crazy slow on chargers 4a and 4b. Charger 2b worked much better, 100+kw. Battery was preconditioned and at about 45% SoC when we arrived."
"For some reason, charging has been incredibly slow the last month. Like 50-60kw only, even when I’m the only one there charging. Used to be much faster. What’s up?! Also, there we’re two chargers out of order recently for over a week. I finally called to inform them (after much searching and navigating the voicemail system) so the chargers could be fixed. Tesla didn’t seem to be aware of any issues. Don’t they have ways to tell? At least they fixed them pretty quickly. The place gets pretty full at times. I do live the location and live that tree hey have a windshield washer and a garbage can, but I think it’s time for more chargers in Rochester!"
"For someone who doesn’t know the area this is hard to find. Google maps tells me to turn at this or that street but the sun glare makes it impossible to see street signs. I give it two stars since the Virginia House of Delegates license #1 is here. If you know where the AMC theater is, this charging station is right there. The #1 belongs to the most senior member of the house of delegates. I thought Virginia had Burgesses. Need to go look that up."
"For the purpose of charging this is good. It could have more choices around for food. There is only a Dairy Queen, Applebees, and Subway."
"Fort Wayne's 2nd Tesla Supercharging station, 12 stalls at 250 kW. Conveniently located in the Meijer Grocery parking lot and within walking distance to Biggby Coffee and Steak n Shake."
Found a gem of a charging station …. Wow . 0.17$ almost the whole day and they have about 13-15 chargers .. amzingggggg value for money …  most of the other chargers we used were about .34-0.43 $ .. almost double charge … well placed in rt 1 … right next to Wawa …. 5/5 for sure …
"Found this very large Tesla charging station at the outlet mall. It’s conveniently located just east of I 75. It’s an outlet mall so it does have some restaurants, subway, hamburger joints, Starbucks etc. But I don’t know if they’re open at night, I don’t think so. Anyway this station has 16 250 kW superchargers and 16 level 2 Tesla chargers. I have never seen a charging station with this many chargers.  I think it’s only been open a few months. I don’t think you’ll have any problem with wait times here."
"Four of the 8 charging stalls are not working at the time of this post. There’s been at  least one not working every time we’ve been here.

The charging is slow (74 kW) despite being more expensive than any other Tesla charging station we use. We were one of four charging at the start and the speed of charging remained at that level when there were just two of us. It didn’t go to 120kW until we were the only ones plugged in here.

It’s the only Tesla charging point for miles and is frequently busy. Maintenance obviously isn’t a priority, but should be. The area needs more Tesla charging stations given the use of this one and the poor maintenance of the charge stations here."
"Four of the eight stations had non-EVs occupying them when we got there. Closer inspection showed that 30 minute general parking is allowed for alternate stalls, but while we were charging (7/11/22), the store updated signage such that all eight superchargers are allowed for 30 minute general parking. So basically, you can't trust the number of open stalls indicated by app or nav system. Tesla should consider finding a more reliable location in Jackson. It's a busy parking lot and forming a line is not a good option. If you need to use it, off hours are likely advisable."
"Four out of eight are out of order. Tesla map shows which ones (1A, 1C, 2B, 2C) are not working. But there are no labels on the supercharger so you will have to try to plug in to find out which one is working or not working. Avoid this one if you can."
Four stalls on each side. A Wendys is likely your best bet as far as the fast food goes. Looks like there may be an elevation burger in the lot on the other side of the main structure from the superchargers.
"Four stars bc there’s only one pull IN spot. All the rest are back in spots and this place can be busy!
Sheetz is steps away - food restrooms etc. close to the highway."
"Four Tesla charging station, open to everyone"

Also has Clipper Creek EVSEs with CCS plugs for non-Teslas."
Free coffee for truckers
"Free destination chargers.  Nice location downtown Owatonna.  Walking distance to food, drink and fun."
Free overnight charging. Whats not to love.
Free Tesla and EV charging. Tesla charges at 45 miles/ hour. Walking distance to Holiday Inn and Seafarer Inn.
Free Tesla Destination Charger and Level 2 charger.  Please contact the hotel before using - these are for their guests but they may be happy to share if there aren't any guests in need.

Free Wi-Fi from Starbucks.
"Free, easy, conveniently located for the Great Dunes park, Seafarer, and Holiday Inn. Tesla and other PHEV plus wall outlets and spots for Redbugs."
Free. Charging for Tesla
"Freer’s Tesla charging station #5 Wallingford Connecticut. Bringing in the beautiful, luxurious Tesla’s"
Frequently blocked by ice vehicles and is locked.  Must be a hotel guest to get unlocked.
"Frequently use this charger when visiting North Bay on weekends. Quick charge, in a mall parking lot with Starbucks and other places near by. Grass by supercharger to give your dogs a potty break too."
"Fried fish,Mac and cheese and baked beans was my dinner at Roy Rodgers."
Friendly people work here. No real healthy food options. Fried chicken and burgers galore. Will have your pick of chargers.
Friendly service at nearby Wawa with clean bathrooms and hot meals.
From 10% to 100% charge in less than one hour. Clean and safe. Close to shopping.
From to the north turn right directly after the Citgo station. Great location and fast
"Front row parking is really nice. Free to use. In case some people are wondering, yes you can charge all day while at the park. You don’t have to move the vehicle when charging is complete. There are plenty of spots to charge.
Also, these chargers are on a shared load. What that means is if you’re the only Tesla charging, you’ll get the full 46amps. If other Tesla’s are charging, the load is not only shared, but managed by the software as well. So if you have a very low state of charge and the car next to you is mostly charged, the lower charged car will receive a lot more juice to charge faster, while the other car is still charging but at a lower rate. It’s normal to see charging amps change frequently in your app."
"Full 250kW charging available, Starbucks (amongst other things) down the street."
Full house when I got here and 2 didn’t seem to be working. But there’s a Target to  waste time in.
"Full speed chargers, excellent Sheetz, but this place is filled with adults riding 20 inch huffy bicycles and backpacks. It's always a good time to see people digging through the trash cans while getting a charge.

None of these folks have ever said a word to me though. I try to avoid this charger but somehow it's always needed for me."
"Fun for the whole family while you charge. There is wine and gift store with tastings, ice cream, carousel, and choo choo train for the kids, and a restaurant. Restrooms are located in the gift/wine store. Peacocks are walking all around."
Fun to see it ramp-up over 1k mi/hr for a spell. Fast. Convenient. Available.
"Fun weekend rental!!! Great for driving around town, not so great for the long trip on vacation. We didn't count the extra time needed to stop and charge 3x on our trip but we didn't have to charge the whole weekend while we were on vacation. Comfy and smooth ride and so much fun to play with all the controls! This car really has it all!"
"FYI this is still open during construction, even if Tesla warns you on their nav. Used it successfully on 5/18/18."
Garbage! Just like their vehicles!
Gas Station bathrooms are ok. I came when Huddle House was closed so I did not experience any delays charging. Not very amenity rich like some superchargers.
"Gas station closes from around 12-5am. This is bad because I can’t use the bathroom. Traveling to Dallas.  Wish there was another supercharger between Childress and Denton so I don’t have to spend over an hour charging.  Oh, and there is a dog that won’t stop barking. Try not to travel to Childress around 3am like we did."
"Gas station in the middle of NOWHERE with charging stations... That was all good, but at 9:30 pm the station is closed and there are NO OTHER RESTROOMS around. Had to charge, then make another stop for the restroom. Also, a little creepy out there alone. EDIT: Stopped to charge during ""business hours"" ... Restroom in the gas station is nasty. NOTHING else to do around here but sit in your car."
Gas station restroom is trash
"Gasoline at one end, electrons at the other. This Buc-ee's has a bunch of pumps and while you're waiting, food, clothing, brisket sandwiches and the cleanest restrooms you will find on the interstate."
"Gen 1 destination charger compatibility issues.
Adjusting current charge on charging screen to "
Generally not too busy. Lots to do within short walking distance.
"Gets the job done. The applebees employees don't seem to care for the people who use the charger. I felt like they went out of their way to make it take longer than a charge so I'd have to go move the car. I've tested this theory a few times. Never busy either.

In short, the charger itself is fine, the businesses surrounding the chargers aren't thrilled about it."
"Getting 10 kW. Several restaurants, coffee, and groceries nearby."
Getting 117 kW in my M3P today.  Nice!  Next to a Sheetz for services.
Getting 25 miles/hr charge on a Model 3.  ~6.5 kW.  A bit low but not bad.  Four spots all seeming to be in good shape.  I’m the only one here today and hotel staff said it’s not used much so almost certain to have a spot
"Getting some practice before Kate's diesel prohibition starts. Funny thing about electric cars- from looking at the data..   my 22,000lb truck powered by an 855 cu in diesel is just about the equivalent to the average electric car when looking at  "" global environmental harm"" ""depletion of natural resources"" and "" use of fossil fuels"" -huh, I guess diesel in my truck burns cleaner than coal in power plants that make the electricity that charges the "" clean cars"". I guess they are actually powered by coal and low grade high sulfur crude oil.  ,aside from the small contribution of hydroelectric, the much smaller contribution of solar and wind. Wind power is another topic for another day.
Fusion and fission are the only hopes of breaking away from fossil fuels. Look at the numbers.
Just something to ponder......"
"Getting your car into one of these chargers is very dangerous. You have to back into oncoming traffic from both sides & the chargers are placed next to a curve, which creates a blind spot from one direction and cars speed around the curve before seeing the cars pulling in and out of the charging spaces. Please place a SLOW or STOP sign on both sides of where the chargers are located! Other than that, it’s nice that the chargers are located next to a Wegmans!"
"Giving 1 star only because there was a 30+ minute wait today. Avoid this charger if possible, it's way too busy. The Mexican restaurant next door is good while you wait."
"Glad it's there, although another one right near Stowe would be great! It's not a 250kw, it is busy and it shares with the other Tesla in your row, so it can take a bit longer to charge than I'm used to. The convenience store is better than most, although the cashier could have been nicer. I mistakenly walked up to the alcohol only check out, she let me know with zero empathy and moved over to the regular check out and asked the woman essentially behind me if she could help her at the regular check out - not nice :-("
Glad Tesla placed a SC in Vicksburg MS. Used it today and it charged my M3 quickly.
"Glad they added a station for my comute from Raleigh to Fayetteville, and they currently working on another in benson. Can't wait!!"
"Glad they are easy to use,  but we go on average about 15- 30 miles out of the way to get electricity.  It takes about 30 minutes to get a good charge,  in the mean time find somewhere to walk to."
"Glad they have a spot so close to Yuma, clean gas station and bathrooms but I think they installed these supercharges backwards haha. Not a huge deal as it's not too crowded here but I had to take away a star for it."
"Glad to finally have one in Victorville, the one in Hesperia is too far and very inconvenient. There is a gas station like 1 min walk away and a jack in the box across the street."
Glad to see more and more of these popping up!
Glad to see the Tesla supercharger network growing very strong to meet demand. You can shop and eat here while you juice up and it's very clean. Keep it up Tesla team.
"Glad we've got more on us19. Strong cell data, can stream in car. Persistent ICEing of chargers by huddle house zombie beasts. Usually not busy, so not a big deal. Beware if nav only shows a couple open."
Go Fairmont
Go late at night and still gives you a solid supercharge! And its really cheap ($.17 per khw
"Go to lot: ""long term 2."" I used charger ""C1"" and it supercharged immediately @110kW. Only six others came through b/w 5-6pm, all of which stayed with the vehicle, so no one taking a spot longer than just to charge. There's EV chargers directly to the right of the entrance where you grab the ticket, but the Tesla chargers are a little further along on the right. Was not charged for being there 35mins"
Go to the second floor. Ground floor has non tesla chargers
"Go to this charger regularly as it's on my way to work

Generally my preferred timings are convenient and empty so it works.out.

Empty when i went at 830am weekday"
Good

Good
Good  location. Plenty of places to eat. Or order before you get there and eat while you charge. Pretty busy but not too full
"Good , superfast charger"
"Good access, close to 295, nj turnpike, & rt38. ice vehicles park in ev spots, so be aware."
"Good accessibility to food and shops, but charge rage is slow, ~60 kWh, even though only half the spots were being used."
"Good amenities at Fred Meyers but only 150kw charging that drops to 75kw if adjacent stall is changing. Slower charging is perfect if you have shopping to do, but not if you're just passing through."
Good and fast!
Good and spacious place. There is a Woodrow's BBQ place that also sells random things you would see at Buccee's. Clean restrooms. There is also a subway in that plaza as well. Good stop between Houston and Dallas.
"Good area for a charging station other than it’s far from the highway.  It is next to a Starbucks and a Guru’s Sports Bar within walking distance.  Was a little disappointed with the Starbucks Restroom, very filthy and floors were definitely not clean."
Good charge and decent places nearby. Hs trouble taking my charging plug from the car but a nearby dude helped which was nice. Nice people. Parked here and ate an I dian restaurant 10 min walk away. That made it extra worth it
Good charge but zero around to eat or entertain you.
"Good charge rate at 72 Amp, 41 mi/hr. Located behind the Holiday Inn Express."
"Good charge rate, can get a bit busy. Driving through but Jackson looks like a nice town to check out in the future. In the Whole Foods parking lot because, of course. EV friendly organic eco-conscious hippies. :) Pretty sure most people here are coming in or out of Teton/Yellowstone."
"Good charge rate. About 100kw with many other cars. Great location with Trader Joe’s, but the parking lot is quite crowded and tight getting here and leaving."
Good charge speeds and not conjested plus food and a convenience store on site
Good charge stop. At Winn dixie parking lit. There’s a McDonald’s nearby plus there is a Elliano’s coffee spot near the chargers. Looks new and not open just yet. Will be a nice addition. The are head in chargers. Which I like better.
"Good charge, 4 stations. Dairy Queen and Subway for food.  Bathrooms were filty when I arrived"
Good charger - there are food places in the shopping center it is in
Good charger but location not well marked. It is on the lower most floor in Parking. Charging rate is bit slow but it is ok as you can do other things here like shopping etc
Good charger located in parking area around Sheetz so food and rest area is available.
Good charger location with many restaurants within walking distance. Speeds are a bit choppy and don't seem to be hitting as high as some others at same SOC (state of charge).
Good charger with multiple spots. However get here before 9 PM due to gasoline vehicles taking the EV spaces.
"Good charger, but the store does not accept Visa credit cards"
"Good charger, easy to get to, with lots of spaces and access to many things to do or eat in the stores nearby."
Good charger.  Very fast.  Across from Mom’s Organic Market
Good charger. Originally started on 3B but it wouldn’t pull more than 76 kWh. Switched to 4B and instantly pulled 139kWh.
good chargers.   Applebees next door and not many other walkable places (it was a very cold day).  but also a mall to kill time if necessary
Good charging location it was easy to get in and out.
"Good charging location, easy to find right off the interstate. Conveniently located next to Hampton Inn if you want to spend the night. Charging tops out at 150kw. Looks very clean and safe."
Good charging location. Hotel and restaurants near. Shopping isn't too far either.
Good charging speed without waiting. Go go Tesla. We need more superchargers!
"Good charging speed, not busy. Restaurants nearby, trash can on site."
"Good charging speed. Location is a bit isolated, your closest bathroom is a 5 minutes walk over to the mall and then inside"
"Good charging speed. Not many things around. Gas station is busy. You can use restroom there. Barbecue place and Mexican restaurant nearby. Subway on other side of the road.
Make sure you enter in to Parker’s gas station area and chargers are on your right side. You can enter from back and use charger from other side too."
"Good charging speeds and not too busy (in the AM). This is not the most powerful charger I've visited, though. I have only been here early in the morning, so it may get busier as the day wears on. It's next to a Freddies, which opens at 7am."
"Good charging speeds. Though the charge speed reduces after some time, the initial kWh is decent enough. It reduced to 45kW after 15 minutes. It took like 45 mins for a full charge, which was not expected. I was surprised."
"Good charging spot, plenty of stations. The gas stations spots to eat could make it better but I’ll take what I can get as far as convenience is concerned."
Good charging station with a Kwik Trip within walking distance across the parking lot.
Good charging station. Limited food and restroom options but we were able to use the Harveys grocery store for a restroom break. Sonic is next to the Tesla chargers and their awning gives shade if you want to stretch your legs. Plenty of chargers and very busy with other Tesla's charging.
Good charging stop. 8 Tesla charging bays. Right next to a nice 24 hour diner (Olympic Diner) so there is always food and a place to sit. Right off the highway.
"Good charging. Grocery store nearby (Trader Joe's). Upscale shopping and food in the shopping center, if that's your thing. Overall, it's a pretty decent charger."
Good clean amenities. Charging started out fast. One of the chargers gave an error. Recommend heading across the street for Wheat Jesus.
Good clean functioning chargers. Probably the least disgusting Chargers in atlanta. All the others are buried under garbage and chicken parts. Have fun in East Point
"Good clean location with restroom in Meijer, charge rate excellent on a Sunday afternoon!"
"Good clean location, very well stocked convenient store,  and others very close"
Good convenient Supercharger. Easy access bayhrooms
Good daytime location with grocery store nearby
Good donuts with a clean bathroom across the parking lot at Toby's
Good experience charging my tesla here there was a gas station and they have free water for tesla drivers
Good experience here. Got food at the Mexican place across the road while waiting for eV to finish charging.
Good experience. All chargers were full upon arrival but only had to wait a minute or so. Good location too at Wawa.
"Good facility for Tesla owners. Rates are low and with in 45 to 60min your car will be fully charged. Plenty of charging stations so no traffic at all. Parking rates are 0-3hrs = $4, 3-4hrs =$8, 4-6hrs =$15. Your call will be charged with in $4. Its upto you how many hours you spending in mall you have to pay for parking space as per hours."
"Good fast charger, close to freeway in holiday inn parking lot. There are McDonalds, Denny's, Walmart and a few other amenities within walking distance (about 1 block) - but the driveway down to the stret is wuite steep"
"Good for a quick charge. Wawa has just about anything you need. Drinks,snacks,food. Bathrooms not bad."
"Good for charging, but not for motel stay.
If possible , prefer one at meijer 250kw charge station."
Good Hotel to rest overnight and charge for free. We will be back. Thank you.
Good if you are in dire need to charge. Hard to see the location during night time. Expensive than normal superchargers.
"Good if you are staying at that hotel.  But it's awkward to access and the so called public restroom requires a key that didn't work wen I was there.  The nearest restaurants are a clumsy walk behind a dumpster and down a narrow stair and were both closed during my visit at 11:00 am.  But, its reasonably fast, more so than the destination chargers elsewhere in northern AZ so I was glad to have it!"
Good juice from a 150w station. 3rd visit and have yet to have to wait (but I've always visited very late after business hours)
"Good lighting, shopping mall and a Sonic, BBQ and Target nearby. But one of the slowest charging rates of any supercharger I’ve ever used. Slow with or without other cars."
Good location
Good location adjacent to gas station with clean restrooms. 150 kW chargers. Never more than one other vehicle present.
Good location adjacent to the mall and restaurants. Filthiest charging station I've ever been to.
Good location and decent charging speeds
Good location and it worked well.  V2 technology.
"Good location but charging was extremely slow (270 kw/hr) there are 8 chargers but only on 2 circuits (1 ABCD, 2 ABCD)."
Good location but not always functional. Closed down for 3 days now.
Good location deep in oil/gas country.
"Good location depending on when you are stopping by this charger.

When most businesses are open, you are able to use their washrooms  and purchase something from them.

When it is later in the day and the businesses are closed, you are kind of forced to walk a bit further to get to a washroom or a snack.  The area is well lit when there is no sun. We walked over to Walmart before they were closed for the day and was back before the charging session was completed.

Have been to this location a few times and haven't found any of the chargers not working properly."
"Good location for a stroll to UNA or downtown Florence. Not super fast but nice to have.  I've never had a problem with access, crowding, or operation.  Access to the parking lot may be restricted when UNA classes are in session.  I'm not sure."
"Good location for charging located in the back lot of a well-equipped Sheetz convenience store with decent restrooms. We bought some grab-n-go salads, after rude service at nearby O'Charley's. Spaces are back in. It was a little busy for a Tuesday night but we managed."
Good location for charging. Can do a lot of things while ur baby charges up. But it can get busy in the evenings and weekends. They need to build more
Good location for charging. There's a super market nearby with a cafe that has good coffee. Plenty of food and other services nearby but not right at the charger.
Good location for fast charge. Was quiet and safe around 11:30pm. Well lit area.
"Good location in gas station lot w/ fresh market eatery. Station 1a appears to be inoperable. Gas station bathrooms closed, but not Teslas fault. No hotels close by."
Good location next to a couple of gas stations and right off the highway. All stalls are working now and charge a consistent 90kw even with Teslas coming and going.
Good location next to a Dairy Queen and a supermarket with prepared food.
"Good location next to a former Mission, now hotel, with a decent restaurant and very clean restrooms. There are also other fast-food options in walking distance."
"Good location off of I 24. Has multiple different stores like Walmart Goodwill harbor freight, eating places like Cracker Barrel, Taco Bell, KFC, subway and Mexican, long John silver. Also has Hampton inn 100 ft away.
Not many people.
One of the fastest charger started at 400 miles / hr."
Good location off of i20 and in a Publix parking lot. This location is busy during rush hour.
"Good location off the I-5 with a restaurant and convenient store across the parking lot. There was only one spot open when we pulled in and stayed full the entirety of our charge but we still got 100+kw. No homeless people, broken down vehicles or trash to speak of."
Good location plenty of chargers just very very slow charge rate
"Good location right along with sheetz gas station. Easy access, sheetz have fresh food and clean restroom too!"
"Good location right off I-12. Located in a shopping center parking lot with Target, Taco Bell, Chick-Fil-A and a gas station within walking distance."
Good location to charge up. There are different food and shopping options to choose from.
"Good location to stop and grab some food/drinks/ice cream,  etc... from Granzellas across the street.  Be aware,  prices aren't cheap for food.  Bathroom available near the back bar section.

It's smaller,  so expect to hang out for at least 30-40 min depending on how much you charge."
"Good location with a few stores nearby, namely a Starbucks."
Good location with lots of grass for dog bathroom breaks. Plenty of food locations - the coffee shop next door is excellent!
Good location with options of food.
"Good location with plenty of shops (well stocked grocery store)  nearby,  but if you have more than 2-3 other cars charging at the same time... you'll be waiting longer.   KWH drop fast as it's not set up for too many EVs.  Also, my car didn't record the cost of the charge properly.   Later,  it was updated accordingly."
"Good Location within a well lit shopping center near Target.  In & Out Burger is located within walking distance.  Other options for snacks and food are good.  Public Restrooms are located in several of the stores during business hours; Target is the closets. Good options for Dog walking, plenty of grassy areas nearby."
Good location you have sheets and a mall across the street but a lot of ice going on
"Good location, a little walk if your interested in getting fast food thats the downside but not terriable"
"Good location, cheaper than Iowa! Lots to do around here. All seem to be working."
"Good location, Elon Rules!"
"Good location, fast charge. Sheetz is a stone throw away for food and restrooms."
"Good location, just off the highway. Easy to navigate to and plenty of stations.

Charging a Tesla is fast and easy at these stations. I rented one and was amazed at the ease. No dirty convenience stores to go in. Just back up, push a few buttons, and sing a song or two while waiting for the fast,  super fast charging."
"Good location, my Tesla had a hard time finding.  It’s right beside a stand alone StarBucks Coffee (opposite Petsmart) in a strip mall."
"Good location, next to meijer, starbucks, and a mexican restaurant among other things"
"Good location, not busy"
"Good location, not crowded, in good order, restrooms, convenience store and fast food nearby."
"Good location, right next to a BBQ place, McDonald's, and Dairy Queen. We've rarely had to wait for a spot."
"Good location, right off interstate, fast charging, 24hr sheetz with food and clean bathrooms.  Parking is in front, and you are walking distance to lots of shopping (Dicks, Kohls, Target, etc).... but you have to walk behind and around the dicks sporting goods store.  Also, if it's crowded, there could be congestion on the side near the air compressor."
"Good location, right off Route 287. Has one extra charging stall that can accommodate a storage hitch or bike rack very well. I have been to this charging location numerous time and charging speak were consistent. There is a Dunkin’ Donuts nearby with Wi-Fi access if needed. Many other shops are within walking distance including a McDonald’s"
"Good location, safe area, convenient shopping and restaurants nearby. Found a pair of shoes in the bushes... Not sure what happened but... He ded. 😳

Edit: this location continues to be a regular stop for us on our road trips through Alabama. However, I have to say I'm shocked at all the littering Tesla owners do for being owners of eco-friendly cars.... There is a trash can like 30 yards away guys... Use it!"
"Good location, with a decent Wawa. No iceing of the chargers while I was here. Started at around 100kw. 5 minutes from 95, to get back to 95 exit towards the back of the Wawa. That'll out you at a light for easy exit."
"Good location: just off the road. There are a few restaurants and Starbucks in case if you need coffee to wake you or male you go. However, this is the only charging station by far we could not find a restroom. All public restrooms were closed. So it was tough :)"
Good location! Covered and easy access for Naperville downtown area! Great to charge when it’s snowing or rain..
"Good location.  Crave Bakery and Coffee Bar is across the parking lot as well as Soulivia's Art and Soul... an upscale restaurant with southern food, bar, patio and live music on most nights."
Good location.  It's located next to Wing Stop.
"Good location. “L”-shaped locations encourage eye contact, so be mindful if you’re taking a big ol bite of your lunch and don’t have tint on your windows.

Other real talk: I found a cup of urine placed nicely next to one of the chargers at this location. It had a lid on it, so, uh, that was nice."
Good location. Feels safe. No restrooms if nearby stores are closed. Which they are on Sundays.
Good location. Meijer gas station has bathrooms and $1 sodas
Good location. Mexican restaurant is near by. Mall area.
Good location. Next to Chesapeake Expressway 168.
Good location. Restrooms in the Best Buy close by.
Good location. Subway and dollar general nereby. Not all stations were operational though.
"Good location. There is a grocery store (Myrtle Creek Grocery Outlet, and a few fast food restaurants on site, including McDonald's. No problem finding a bathroom or food."
Good location. They should have more units installed.
Good location.. hotels within walking distance for bathroom needs after hours. I personally love olive garden but haven't gotten lucky enough to stop here while they are open
"Good locations on the way from El Paso to Albuquerque.  Dennys, McDonalds, Walmart and a few other places at a walking distance."
Good number of chargers and location!
"Good on and off from interstate with plenty of food options. Zaxby's, Sonic and a Publix. Has a trashcan for folks using  supercharger. Was overflowing. Always a disappointment. Otherwise, great place to charge."
Good place
"Good place to charge for free. Don’t have to be a registered guest at Hampton. Slow charge, but enough to get back to a supercharger on the mainland."
Good place to charge right next to 2-3 restaurants.
Good place to charge Tesla. Fast charging. Lot of restaurants nearby.
Good place to charge up or gas up. Clean restrooms and food court
"Good place to charge your car. Has convenience stores, few gas stations and even a hydrogen fuel station. Charged thrice to 250+ miles in 40-45 minutes"
Good place to park with no one bothering you for the night.
Good place with good food options nearby
"Good place, but it's often busy. Good options are available for time passes."
Good rates. Bathroom at the gas station. Pretty view.
"Good roomy location, if you have pets be careful of the grass/weed area behind the charging stations, there are some prickly ball things"
Good services!
Good sheetz and super charger
Good speed (but there weren't many cars when I showed up) and with Wendy's /truck stop right there it's a perfect location
Good speed. I saw hertz charging their Tesla's. One guy walking with a handful of keys wearing Hertz shirt. There is another brand charger so you see Kia or Hundai and Ford etc.
"Good speeds. If you need to go to the Nation at night (after 9pm) Walmart maybe your best bet, a little walk or go first then charge if you don't want to walk. During the day the businesses are open. We used the one at the coffee shop when it was open the last time we were at this super charger. During the day decent amount of shops, restaurants, & coffee while charging."
Good spot
Good spot but these chargers still share power between the two conjoining stalls. So just keep that in mind when you park.
Good spot next to the interstate.
"Good spot to charge next to the highway. Pizza, Taco Bell, Burger King, and Grocery store in the parking lot."
"Good spot to charge. Restaurant, bathrooms, food and coffee nearby at the travel plaza."
Good spot to charge. Sheetz has public bathrooms and plenty of food along with WiFi and an eating area to hang out. There are some outdoor seating areas too. The subtraction of one star is simply due to the difficulty of getting out of Sheetz since the intersection has long lights.
"Good spot to charge. Unfortunately not shaded, but walking distance to a Target and other shops. 20 min to half charge to make it back home."
"Good spot to recharge. With a Dunkin Donuts inside the Oasis, it makes for a good and quick stop despite not looking like a lot to offer."
"Good spot to recharge. With a Dunkin Donuts inside the Oasis, it makes for a good and quick stop. Bathrooms are clean. There is also a fast Charge Point."
"Good spot. In parking lot of Zaxby's and Mellow Mushroom, so two places for bathroom, and food super close. Charger was fast, all seemed to be working. Only issue was two ICE vehicles parked in two of the spots, still had extra spots available."
"Good spot. Near restaurants, shopping, fast food, and Starbucks. No requirements for use, just pull up and plug in. Location close to skyline drive makes this a great topup spot."
"Good stop between Houston and Livingston. It is located on the side of Holiday Inn. Speed is ok, 78kW. You can use restroom inside the hotel, restaurant is within walking distance.
Update: All the stalls are in working order. Speed is upto 120kW for my Model 3 SR+. Restroom is closed due to Covid."
"Good stop for during the day. We always enjoy a sit down meal at Texas Roadhouse (and with 20 percent off). Please note they're having staffing issues and can be slow. So plan on staying a bit.

If you're stopping here when Texas Roadhouse isn't open, you could try the gas station next door."
"good stop for travelers as there is food & restroom options within walking distance. It's right off i10. well lit at night, plenty of space to reverse without feeling rushed. hotel is right behind the stalls, which may be convenient for tired travelers.

only earned three stars from me since the charging speed is not as advertised on the app, so a bit slower than all other SC i've visited."
Good stop to charge. Bathrooms are close enough. Awesome taco shop across the street called La Raza to eat while charging.
Good stop to grab coffee at Starbucks or Pete's while charging when we are heading to Tahoe.
"Good stop. Lights at night, close mall with bathrooms. Seem to be food nearby. Second floor of garage so not as convenient as other stops. No easy disposal of car trash or way to let a pet relieve themselves. Slightly slower charge rates  This is a good city topup spot, not the ideal stop for long road hauls"
"Good stop. Next to sheetz, well-lit and feels safe at night. Sheetz is decent - clean restrooms and some gas-station food options. There are a few eating spots within walking distance, and a few more if you're willing to cross a larger road. Most nearby options are fast food, there is a grocery nearby, but few sit-down restaurants. Small grassy area behind cars appropriate for relieving pets. When exiting the parking lot you'll want to use the exit on the south side - if you exit northwards (onto washington) you will need to pull a u-turn to to head back towards the highway."
"Good SuC stop! Restrooms, food, plenty of room. What more could you want?"
Good super charger a little hard to find but using this google maps pin is exactly where it is at. Can go into the hotel for a few while it charges. Only tesla there when I was there charging.
Good super charger the only thing is not much directions. It is in a parking garage on the 3rd floor. Also it didn't have much around for easy access.
"Good supercharge devices, there are more than 10 charge slots, but have no WC around there"
"Good supercharger location, a lot of chargers to choose from. Decent area with hotels and fast food nearby. No issues with the chargers themselves or anything else."
"Good supercharger location. A bit off the highway but located on a good spot in the back of the  Meijer parking lot. Bathrooms available in the Meijer entering the door on the left closes to the charger there in front closer to the opposite door. There are food choices across the parking lot: Chick fil a, Five Guys, Mod Pizza were what I remember. Also there is a Starbucks inside the Meijer. 150kW V2 chargers at this location."
"Good Supercharger right near the exit of a multistory parking structure. It started out giving me over 300 miles per hour of charge when I had only 35 miles  left on the battery. Once I was close to full, I was still getting 127 miles per hour of charge."
Good supercharger spot next to a hotel with a bar and restaurant I think too.
"Good supercharger spot, back in only stalls. Not much for healthy food options. Stalls are also split up weird so you may be best to pull beside someone so pay attention to the a’s and b’s."
"Good supercharger stop. Chargers right by gas, felt safe, decent grassy spot for dog. Smallish store had usual selections, fried chicken, good slushies for hot day. Small bathrooms."
"Good supercharger, easy to get too, fast charging. Limited eating options, but the Casey's was clean and convenient."
Good supercharger.  Not busy and had a nose-in spot so we didn't have to unhitch our trailer. It was on the far corner of the parking lot so not at all busy. There were toilets in the gas station.
Good supercharger. I wish it was 150kW instead of 75kW max. I also wish there was some shade. But other than that it has a great location and it seems pretty empty. Getting a steady 44kW.
"Good supercharging location. Had great snacks, good customer service, and clean bathrooms. Thanks for the great experience here."
Good supercharging location. Places to eat across the street or shop at Winn Dixie. Nice area in general.
Good Supercharging locations with tons of amenities 250KW V3 Superchargers are so fast truly recommend this location for any Teslas to charge
Good supercharging. Convenient to have Giant Eagle grocery to shop while you charge. I wish they had one in Robinson which gas a lot of stores.
"Good Tesla destination charger. There are two of them and they both work, charging at 10kw. I was at 13% so to charge up to 100% it would take 6h25min."
Good visuals. The neighborhood felt dicey as i watched a group of people fighting in the parking lot at the hotel across the way. But otherwise it was a nice place to stop
Good way for Woodmans to get more business. Should have more general evs or may be Tesla will open up for more EVs next year
"Good, newer location, in Champaign / Normal, Illinois.  Tesla charging rates have gotten higher lately but still cheaper than gas.  Fast charge rates, as advertised, and plenty of food options nearby.  Not far from the Mall."
"Good, safe location, clean, near shopping and clean restrooms, a park is nearby so you can stretch your legs if you need."
"Good: Right by noodles and other stores, around 6 stalls
Bad: the charger is advertised as UpTo 150 KW. You don't get that. All the stalls get you a max of 56kw. Car was preconditioned, wouldn't go over 56 kw.I would drive 30 miles to Menemonie and use 250 KWH chargers."
Good. Working.
Good💐
Google Maps shows an older building that no longer exists. Sheetz made an expansion and added the Superchargers.
"Got 150kW rate from older chargers by hotel, 250 kW from the newer chargers. A Tesla pulling a trailer was blocking most of the new chargers though.
Restrooms in the Market are way in back to the left."
"Got 251 kW briefly on Oct 11 when charging at this new Supercharger. Technician was working on it, and before he left he said it recently opened. We were almost done, when suddenly charging stopped for all the Teslas there. Hope it will be working when we need it again!
Casino has restrooms in lobby on either side of big fireplace - see red/blue arrows in my photo."
"Got a 70% charge in 15min for under $20. If you have a Tesla superchargers are the only way to go, especially if you're on a long haul trip. Thanks Sheets!"
"Got a great charge here, car ramped up to 250kw right away, pulled in with 3% charge left. Nice clean bathroom at the convenience store and burger king is walking distance. Charged here for 20 minutes got plenty range for our next stop in PA."
Got a Tesla from Avis. I am in love. These stations make it so easy. Charged in 40 min or less. Some stations have a charge limit but that's ok.
Got about 25 mph while charging here. The Mexican restaurant is yummy!
"Got around 120kwh even though only car charging, worked great"
"Got here at 12 noon on a Wednesday.  We’re the only car charging.  Fast charger.  Food in Service Plaza okay, the usual, Wendy’s, Peets Coffee, etc.  plenty of restrooms."
"Got here early in the morning and the charging rate was nice at only 14 cents per minute.  It also conveniently located within the Meijer parking lot so you can go shopping in Meijer while you're charging.   I'm not sure what the rates are later in the day or during the week because when I charged in Indianapolis, the first 20 minutes was 72 cents per minute."
"Got here on a Monday morning and was the only Tesla until the white M3 joined me. Charging was consistent and as advertised. Finding the chargers was not hard. Going West as soon as you exit, hit an immediate right turn and then another right turn into the hotel parking lot. The young guy in the front office was nice. Bought water, talked a bit, and allowed me to use the bathroom. I wasn't hungry so I can't comment on the food situation however there are snacks for sale in the lobby. This charging station has the basics. Nothing fancy. Pretty much an in and out kinda vibe."
"Got here very early on a cold December morning.  I was expecting at least a 250 mi/hr charging, but very disappointed to see much lower charging speeds.  There was only one other charger occupied at this time.

Great location for getting something to eat or drink though while you wait for the charging to complete."
Got my car from 50 to 100 in 30 minutes. Nice and fast!
"Got my Tesla literally for only two days. In perfect condition. I came in to charge, and my wheel got curbed!!! I wish I could have just drive there myself instead of a Valet. I'm unsure if it’s a SF thing. The damage looks fresh. The staff claimed it came in like that and that management won’t be able to do anything for me.

I’m upset but I’m unsure what I can even do... I hope someone else won't be as unlucky as me. I supposed at least the car didn’t get dented."
Got some needed charge at 40 mi/hr.  Only charger anywhere near here.
Got there early on a Friday.  First one in.  When I left there were several others there.
"Got there to find the snow plows pile the snow in front of the chargers. When I asked the Sheetz if they had shovels so I could shovel enough to get my car in they said it was broken. I did not have enough to make it to another supercharger, and all Tesla Customer Service told me to do was to go to a Destination Charger."
"Gotta love the 250's speed (Charge Rate)
Right at WaWa store entrance. 2 stalls of 6 bays each (there's 12 stations I believe and all are busy around noon, no matter what time ya show up, but at least they're 250's and if someone charges next to you, it's not as big of a deal because of its speed. Glad Tesla is actually doing what they said in this past year. That was to upgrade ALL the existing 150's to the much MUCH better/faster ones. A+ 👍👍"
Grab a beer and a hotdog while you charge.
"Grab a coffee next door @ Biggby, Pickup a Subway inside Meijer or stock up on things for others that may help them along their way ... You can also enjoy some yummies @ Culver's just a few steps away ... 👍🤠"
Great
Great
Great
Great
Great  location very close to the ski trails only downside is every now and then a truck will park in it.
"Great ""Drive through"" charger"
Great 250 charges and lots of them!
"Great 250kW superchargers. Next to a supermarket and RiteAid, and McDonalds for quick restroom and ice cream cone break."
"Great 250kWh superchargers. It doesn’t get too full, which is great! It’s outside a Bucee’s which is a major plus! Huge convenient store and wide selection of food. Always clean restrooms and staff is very nice. I recommend buying the roasted pecans!!!"
"Great 40 amp level 2 Tesla chargers and non Tesla chargers.
Free charging. Awesome"
Great addition to the Boone area! The chargers are located with the CVS parking area.
"Great alternate charging spot if the older Eau Claire supercharger is full or busy. This one is a V3 supercharger,  so can charge up to 250 kW speeds, which can help speed up your charging session if you're traveling along I-94."
"Great amenities are available within walking distance. Very conveniently located as well in the middle of nowhere, often this is when miles are most needed.  This is not a high usage charger which meant the rate of supercharging was very good."
"Great amenity and almost always available, however it seems a lot slower than other destination chargers.  Perhaps they want to keep you in the casino longer!"
"Great and amazing Doctor, staff is super friendly and accommodating. They really do care and give the best care!"
Great and convenient location if you are staying at Winvian or having dinner there.
Great and peaceful area to recharge plus a great variety of shops and restaurants.
Great area to have dinner (Seaside) and charge your Tesla at the same time. The Level 2 Tesla chargers are free but expect 3 to 4 hours of wait time depending how much battery juice is needed..  it’s similar to you home mobile charger.
"Great area, always kept clean and plenty of places to shop, eat and grab a coffee!"
"Great BBQ place across the street. Fresh slaw and quality food. Surprised to get such a good sandwich so fast while I was charging. Quick at the counter. Hard to see it from the street, but right behind the big EZ sign."
Great boon for those traveling up north in Tesla. Close to Highway exit. Right in Meijer parking lot and few restaurants nearby for those who want to run some errands or grab something to eat.
Great brand new supercharger station 250 kv. They only charged me up at 150 KV for some reason.  I also for some reason they are also now charging $0.45 a kv.  Way overpriced given that a kilowatt and this state is only at most $0.10.
Great charge rate
"Great charge rate and location, loved the mart they have clean restrooms and prepare delicious food, home-made like. Highly recommend."
"Great charge, but only a Sheetz. So if you're hungry, this is all you're getting. The stop is clean, there's a car wash and a place to stretch your legs. Would be 5 stars if there were really other options to walk to."
Great charger and many stores close by.
Great charger and quick for extra miles especially if you stay overnight it’ll be fully charged even from 5% by the morning.
Great charger at Buc-ees. Peaked at 112Kw on a 2019 MX 75d.
"Great charger configuration, but in a less than desirable lot. We were charging at 8:30 pm and watched a large truck circle the lot the entire time. It’s adjacent to a motel so there were a few folks milling about in the lot from there, as well. If I were traveling alone as a single female I wouldn’t feel comfortable stretching my legs outside of the car"
Great charger for a pitstop on a long road trip. It's in the subway parking lot and next to a gas station ⛽. Lots of restroom options. Charges super fast and has a pull in stall  in case you are pulling a trailer or something.
"Great charger for NYC and u pay $4 for an hour which is nothing compared to other chargers. It's not valet which is good. Chargers on P2 and there's a bunch. so chances are, there will be space.

Not necessarily a super charger, maxes at 68-70kW but still better and faster than a lot of other chargers in NYC. I definitely recommend"
Great charger in a great neighborhood.
"Great charger in the back of Wawa.  Fast charging.  Food and bathrooms at Wawa.  Don’t get confused with the Electrify America chargers in front of Wawa.  As I said, Tesla chargers are in the back."
"Great charger location at a big Sheetz that has good bathrooms, food, and drinks.  It's off the highway by a mile or so and there really isn't anything else around but overall a quality location."
"Great charger location with a Target nearby & plenty to spend your money on(Starbucks…).
There were plenty of open chargers with 4 cars including mine charging.
The charger I was at looked like it needed a service visit to correct a few cosmetic issues that could be detrimental to its long term operation."
"Great charger location, great diner on premise. Roscoe is a cool little town with plenty to offer. The chargers are often less crowded than other locations closer to NYC. Late at night it's a serene spot to charge and get some sleep, too."
Great charger location. 1min off the Highway. At a well stocked c store with bathrooms.
Great charger location. If you’re driving at night you might find the route to get there a bit odd as it is retreated from the interstate. The 5R rest Stop is top notch. Restrooms are really clean and store selection is great.
Great charger on our way into door county to see family.
"Great charger station for nighttime. During the daytime, I won't recommend it because it's kinda busy and the price could be double.

Noticing that there's a Tesla free wifi hotspot there, but my car can't connect it automatically unless I get a password.  Would be nice if I could connect thru wifi there while the car is being charged."
Great charger was getting 95 kW at one point... plenty of food choices in the area and shopping.  Just off the i90 highway very convenient location.  It's on a Panera bread and they allow bathroom use however they're closed at 10pm so you'll need to find an alternate of you need the bathroom.
"Great charger with 250KWH charge rate, right behind an Arby's and a dozen food choices within walking and driving range.

We used on 6/23/2022 about 10:30am.  Arrived with 0 of 8 chargers in use. Filled our M3 long range from 35% to 74% in 13 minutes. Initial charging was 220kwh and dropped as the battery filled.

We used again on the return trip on 6/27/2022, arriving about 4pm. Charged our M3LR from 41% to 85% in 20 minutes.

A little bit different layout with 4 chargers on a side and arranged back to back."
"Great charger, but these directions don't take you there. :) After talking with the hotel staff we found the location in the parking structure which is across the street from the Marriott main entrance."
"Great charger, but very busy. During peak times you can expect to wait for a few minutes to find a spot. The Whole Foods is a short walk. The chargers are on the lower level of a parking garage, so it stays shaded. Tesla will need to expand soon in this area."
"Great charger, lots of options around to eat and use washrooms."
"Great charger, next to a Sheetz convenience store which had clean restrooms and a wide variety of food. Also the charger is close enough to a gas pump that you can wash your windows. It was about 5 min off the interstate, so a bit off the beaten path but not too bad."
"Great charger, right next to a Raley’s grocery store, Starbucks, and Taco Bell. Shady parking under trees. Enjoyable stop!"
Great charger! 40 Amps. Charger is located behind the Bluefield Inn. The owners of the Inn are super nice and offer great accommodations if you are ever in town.  The breakfast was amazing!
Great charger! 500 mph! WOOT!
Great charger.  Completely free and charges at 40 amps.
Great charger. Hit 800 mi per hour of range. Sheetz is a decent store for snacks and fast food.
Great charger. Thank you for providing this!
Great chargers for guests at the Far View Lodge. Both a high speed Tesla Destination Charger and a J1772 charger are available.
"Great chargers, all worked. Wish the mall was closer. A Starbucks and a sports grill are within walking distance for eating."
"Great chargers, only 10kW. Hotel staff is very responsive to provide access. These are prime hotel parking. Some of the staff will park there to in order to keep some spots reserved. Granted a little annoying, but better than having to wake a guest up or get someone out of the pool for parking in a Tesla ""reserved"" spot."
Great chargers!
"Great chargers.  And convenient to enter and exit.  Just don't enter the Wawa, that place is filthy OMG."
Great chargers. Lots of non electric cars parked here though
Great chargers. Seems like an unknown location.
Great charging hub with options for a variety of cars. Near a gas station with free restrooms and several restaurants.
Great charging location
"Great charging location, easy entrance and lots of restaurants and a supermarket at this location. Would charge here again!"
Great charging location. Easy to access off the highway. 250kW max with 8 stalls. Right across the street from McDonalds. Two gas stations nearby for bathrooms or convenience store items.
Great charging location. If charging at night you won’t have access to the restrooms inside HEB. There is a gas station and several fast food joints around that will take no more than a 3 minute drive from charger.
Great charging location. Just off I-95 with easy access and egress. Nice big convenience store with clean bathrooms and Dunkin Donuts inside. Out in the open. Fast charging as of the time of this review. Definitely adding it to one of my favorites.
Great charging location. You lose 3-6 miles off your range every time you supercharge your car. I had my 90D for less than a month; I can only charge to 273 miles instead of 294.
Great charging speed. Never any wait. Grocery store parking lot.
Great charging speeds and restrooms right inside the store make it a great spot for charging
"Great charging speeds, conveniently located by Hy-Vee to do some grocery shopping, have a bite to eat etc while you wait."
Great charging speeds! Great location. Parking lot could use a cleaning  🤷🏽‍♂️
"Great charging speeds. Garage is now free to enter as other reviews mention. The park across the street was perfect for walking our dogs while we charged. There are a few restaurants, a bakery, and what looks to be a bar nearby. No public bathrooms readily available as mentioned so plan ahead. Overall an easy and effective charging stop."
"Great charging spot in Publix parking lot (with clean restrooms).
Well lit. Restaurants within walking distance: Sonic, a Chinese restaurant, Zaxby’s chicken, Dominoes. Right off the exit off I-75"
"Great charging spot!
13 bays I think and all super fast  We had no wait tonight.   This station is located on right side of Meijer parking lot (go figure ) and it is easy to get in and out.    The only downside is that Houston Road can get extremely congested so it may be difficult to get into Meijer parking lot at times.   There is easy entrance to both 75 NORTH and SOUTH on Houston Road.  Check out my charge rate and n the attached photo."
Great charging spot. StarBucks and Chick-Fil-A both in walking distance.
Great charging station and super well lit for a midnight stop. Very convenient off the highway. Plenty of functional stations. We were able to use the gas station restrooms and get a quick snack for the rest of our trip. Also walked around the lot to stretch our legs. Wish there were more supercharging stations connected to gas stations like this one.
Great charging station for all owners of Teslas.
"Great charging station for Tesla and Non-Tesla vehicles.  The station is ready for Cyber Truck, lightning, or Rivian with at least two spots that can accommodate a trailer.  Our Ford Lightning was getting around 99 kW at peak."
Great charging station with convenient shopping close by. Rarely ever crowded and I have ALWAYS had an open charging station whenever I went.
Great charging station. We were able to charge up in 20 minutes
"Great charging stations, but the only place to take a bathroom break is in near by restaurants. I am glad Mimi’s was open this morning.
The station needs to have trash can so people can put it in the trash can instead of dumping garbage just by the chargers."
"Great charging, located in a hotel lot with bathrooms available as well as a bar/grill."
"Great charging, we think it is an 80amp circuit shared between 4 chargers because when we were charging alone we got 72 amps but when someone else pulled in we were bumped down to 40 amps"
Great charging!!  And got some Christmas shopping done at meier
"Great clean location with brand new chargers frequented by ghetto, trashy Tesla owners/renters/Uber drivers. It’s a shame Tivoli security is not handing out citations and banning offenders.

I myself drive full time with Uber. I live down the street and come here daily at night only to find pee bottles and fast food bags directly in the parking spots. I can only assume most of the trash is left behind by the same peasants that leave pee bottles and fast food bags at the Uber/Lyft airport staging lot.

OH AND BTW, some of the cables facing the apartment complex wall are not long enough. The concrete/rubber stoppers prevent the cars for backing in all the way to reach the cables."
Great deals on gasoline through the week
"Great destination chargers. They are in the valet area, so plan to enjoy the hotel and amenities."
"Great destination for some family shopping. Lovely shops and restaurants. Enter and go toward the right. Directly across from Sunset Ice Cream and Donna Designs). Tucked between some small bushes. Easy to miss.

Enjoyed the stroll along the boardwalk and hitting the shops."
"Great exit, not far off the highway.  Hotel has nice bathrooms.  However, there would have been so many better places at this exit for the charger. There are lots of places to eat or shop within a very short drive but it isn't practical to walk anywhere so you can't do anything but wait for your charge to finish."
Great experience as usual. Wawa was good although I prefer Sheetz since they have more self checkouts and Wawa never had enough people working the registers.
Great experience! Just had to call ahead to confirm charger availability and was able to charge for hours after paying $10. Well worth it and much needed. Thanks Christine!
"Great experience. Don’t have to go all the way in like the lake Charles supercharger. Never busy. Not many restaurants but there is a McDonalds, subway and a dollar general"
"Great experience. Located in back lot with easy walking distance to food, shops, etc. Owners are accommodating and helpful."
Great facilities all around.  EV Haven very nice
Great facility! Tons of shops in the mall to roam around while charging
Great fast charger
"Great fast charger with *twelve* 250KWH units.  Located on the west side of a Lowe's grocery story, which when open, has very nice bathrooms and plenty of food choices with a coffee shop, and of course all kinds of snacks.  Charge area has both trash bins and recycle bins.

We used on 6/23/2022 about 6:30pm and had 0 of 12 chargers in use. We charged from 32% to 70% in 12 minutes.

We used again on 6/27/2022 about 8:45am.  There was 1 of 12 chargers in use when we arrived. Charged our M3LR from 37% to 85% in 23 minutes."
Great fast charger. Best during the day as there are no late evening or nighttime ancillary shops or stores open.
Great fast chargers in a perfect location for visits to the black hills and Custer state park. Charged at 500 miles per hour!
Great food at the Beef house Indiana
Great for a longer stop bc there’s a Starbucks nearby. I do not recommend Mackenzie river pizza for food- it’s awful mini pizzas for $15 each. Do a Starbucks sandwich instead
"Great free destination charger with two plugs in our amazing eco-friendly neighborhood, but Google Maps shows it as being in the middle of our neighborhood, when in fact the chargers are located at our Whisper Valley Discovery and Amenity Center just up the road."
Great grocery next door. Bathrooms are at back far left
Great Hotel to recharge and get a great nights rest Thank You
"Great hotel, love that they have Tesla destination chargers!"
"Great hotel, quick food, access to clean bathroom"
Great job5 ⭐hasn't changed much still 5 +☆s
Great Kw and pleasant surprise.  airport a few steps away w clean bathrooms and clean airport.  cute little terminal.  located in Long Term 2.  just pull in get a ticket charge and drive out.   don’t know why but guessing the machine knows if you’re only there 15-30 minutes no charge since it’s a long term lot.   Better than most for sure
Great lighting. Target. Lot of food options. 12 chargers.
Great little area by the river! Charging was free too!
"Great little charger next to a wine tasting site and close enough to walk into town for shopping, or dining."
Great little supercharger in a good location. We walked into the hotel to check things out and everyone was so kind everywhere. Really felt like we belonged. Got to see my first Pink Model Y too!
"Great little supercharger station. Good working order, convenient to a few restaurants. IHOP nearby was really fast for a take out breakfast."
Great location
"Great location - right off 75 at a Wawa.  8 stations 250k, and 2 free air stations as a bonus!"
"Great location , a lot of stalls and good food"
"Great location , it’s in the mall so you have option of many store and restaurants."
"Great location , next to Starbucks and gas station . Also close to a Cracker Barrel. All the chargers were up and running !!!"
"Great location (US 41 and I-4). We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and there were only two other Teslas. Easy to get in and get out. Great food and drink options at Wawa. There was a chrome Tesla as well, which looked really nice as well!"
"Great location and 1st Supercharger in Huntsville. Middle of MidCity Development, 12 chargers. Nice"
"Great location and a nice view over the field. Right down the road from Sunday River resort. The bathrooms in the store were very clean and the staff was friendly. While charging a person came up to us and asked how everything worked, pretty fun to explain Tesla to people not familiar with evs!"
"Great location and good charge speed with 3 stalls occupied. Numerous restaurants and shopping. Location is not exactly as indicated on gps. After leaving the main road at the traffic light, immediately turn left at Atlantic Bread Company. You will see the charges ahead on the right."
"Great location and good number of charging stations. Wattage power was good. Many stores like target, cvs, Starbucks are around and the location is walkable to Panera Bread."
"Great location and not busy at all. Enjoy 150kW power and make sure you charge the ""full tank"" before going to Montana. Don't miss a chance to explore local restaurants and cafes there are plenty of them."
"Great location and setup. V3’s, upscale supermarket with huge prepared food section 150’ away, coffee shop inside, and a great Thai place just around the corner. We called take out while we charged on our way home from the cape. Will make a note to stop by again another time."
Great location and solid 40mph. Very convenient to add 50-80 miles while you grab a bite to eat!!
"Great location and super friendly Diamond store who has no issues with you using the chargers even if you are not shopping at the store,"
Great location and surprisingly not busy. The times I’ve been here.
great location and typically good number of chargers available.  I prefer this spot as peachtree corners is typically busy.
"Great location at a great store, Meijer!"
Great location at coop gas bar
"Great location at New Earth Market grocery store. They have a nice bathroom, seating area and deli section. I never shopped there before owning a Tesla but shop now all the time and love some of the products..! Lighting is good in the area and frequented by Police Department."
"Great location at the Sheetz gas station. We grabbed a charge and some snacks while our friends grabbed some gas. Definitely a great way to transition to the electric vehicles becoming more common while retaining amenities like bathrooms and snacks!

No trash or windshield brush at the charger, but I just pulled around after charging to a pump to take care of that. Would be nice to see it all at the chargers so that I could do it while charging (saw this in SC at another larger brand Sphinx gas station)"
"Great location but a bit on the busier side.  Plaza has Starbucks and some fast food options, Wendy's and McDonald's are both walkable."
"Great location but on 11/20/19 1A and 1B were not working, reported to Tesla."
"Great location by Publix, it actually needs to be bigger. They have space to expand."
"Great location close to freeway, restaurant and shops nearby. Fast charging v3. Used it for a trip stop over to California."
Great location for a charge. However I did notice the firehouse subs have put up a sign that you can't use there bathroom if you don't buy a full combo. Kind of a bad look.
"Great location for a charger with tons of bays so no wait! It’s located in the Winn Dixie parking lot. There’s a Subway inside the grocery store and also a McDonald’s and Wendy’s nearby. Lots of grass to take out the pups and garbage cans within walking distance. The area felt safe enough to walk around, however I found I was mostly staring at the ground to make sure I wasn’t stepping on the trash thrown around everywhere."
Great location for a fast charging while you grab a soda or snack
"Great location for a SC. The parking lot is a little small so during peak times the parking spaces might get taken over, but not on a usual basis. Good on Tesla for expanding!"
Great location for a sports fan. These are the older chargers so they do slow down if someone is charging next to you.
"Great location for a supercharger if you wanted to spend the night at the Holiday Inn. 120kw charging capacity. The surroundings are very quiet, the hotel is typically busy with guests. Would be a plus if it was closer to retail shops. Overall great charger location."
"Great location for a supercharger in the Ruby Tuesday parking lot. Well lit, easy in and out and super convenient off Route 80. Other food options nearby, Wendy’s, Cracker Barrel."
"Great location for a Tesla Supercharger. There is so much to do within walking distance. There are 12 stalls. The only downside is that they are A, B, C, and D. If you own a Tesla, you will know what this means. I was only able to get 100 kW charge speeds."
"Great location for all Tesla owners.  Had to do a quick charge from Ellicott city MD before going home 20 miles away. Had 20 miles left on the battery. Cold weather is rough on ev batteries. Thank you Tesla, PlugShare and Leesburg village."
"Great location for charging because they have like 8 stations available.  Resturaunts and shopping is nearby to occupy tour time while your car is recharging.  This is a ""supercharger"" location."
Great location for charging…as long as you aren’t here in the morning since nothing is open. We ended up walking to the extended stay for a restroom. Otherwise it’s clean and lots to do while it charges.
"Great location for day hours, not so convenient for late night drivers as there are no restrooms open late nearby."
Great location for getting on/off interstate 95. Lots of food choices around. Only issue is that they get filled up in the afternoon. The stations maintenance is on point. No issues with any chargers
"Great location for Tesla Superchargers in Mechanicsburg. Super fast charging, is conveniently behind a Sheetz Gas station. 8 stations available!"
Great location for the super charger as the number of teslas on the road in frisco are increasing exponentially. However the charging stalls are not reserved for teslas and I have seen a lot of nut cases parking ICE cars in the charging stalls even though a lot of normal parking stalls are available. These nut jobs who park ice cars in teala charging stalls need to be towed to junk yards
Great location for two CHAdeMO and CCS quick chargers.  Free to use at this time.  I confirmed that they work on my Tesla even though normally I would have used the adjacent Superchargers.
"Great location from Highway 20. It is in center of 3-4 strip malls. Chargers are usually empty. Charging at decent speed. Nearby are lots of stores including Target, Ross, Best Buy’s, some of the clothing stores. Some of the fast foods are near by like Mexican grill, chicken salad chick, firehouse subs and five guys. Walk to Dunkin Donuts that is located in gas station is around 5 min. After 9 pm place can be very quite still looks safe as it is away from main road."
"Great location in a hotel parking lot.  Near Texas Roadhouse and many other restaurants to eat.  All the other Tesla drivers were courteous and friendly.
Don't forget to park every other spot for optimal charging!"
great location in an outdoor mall area.  kW started very well but dropped off.   probably because we were at a pretty high level of charge on our battery pushing it for a long drive to Flagstaff
Great location in Central VA at a Wawa and across the street is a cute little bakery worth heading to while charging.
Great location in Napa and will be better when Circle K opens up.
Great location in the garage. Within parking distance to food and shopping. Nice that it’s shaded and under lighting so you don’t feel unsafe. Never had a problem with broken chargers either!
Great location in the Hampton Inn parking lot. McDonald's is right in front and you can walk there if you want and there's plenty of food options nearby as well. Hampton Inn has public bathrooms if you walk inside and make a left past the front desk.
Great location in the parking lot of a Wawa and across the street from a 24 hour CVS. I noticed a sign tucked away that said 40 min max charging time so that may be utilized when it’s busy.
Great location in the parking lot of an outlet mall. 16 stalls and only 3 were taken on a Sunday at noon. Solid charging speed.
Great location just off I-26 in Steak and Shake Parking lot. Nice grassy area that gave my dog a chance to play fetch on our road trip.
Great location just off i-83. Headed to Baltimore. McDonalds just around the corner. Not a very busy station on a Wednesday evening. I only saw a Model 3 arriving just as I was leaving after charging for 12 minutes.
"Great location just south of Highway 1 in Brandon. Can't complain about the huge variety in shopping and food options in walking distance of the chargers.

Having a trailer-friendly stall on the end of the supercharger bank is the icing on the cake.

No doubt the best placed supercharger location between Regina and Winnipeg, and always reliable and delivering the full 250 kW even when the station is totally occupied too."
"Great location lots of food options nearby, I hope they upgrade this to the 250kw version 3 chargers soon, would love a bit more speed."
"Great location near I-69. Located behind Starbucks, Sweet Monster Ice Cream, Mike's Car Wash in the Meijer parking lot. Plenty of options nearby for food, restrooms, and shopping."
"Great location near multiple restaurants (i.e., Panera, Bob Evans, Cracker Barrel) brushless do-it-yourself car wash and a hotel to use the restroom."
Great location near Sagamore bridge. Can get busy Sundays during the summer.
"Great location near the freeway (.3 mile) and plenty of stores around. I didn’t see any restaurants so ate downtown at the Bounty Hunter Bar. It was not busy even at 2:30p.m. On a Saturday in May with many wineries fully booked. It seemed a little slow to top out at 315 miles (add 185 miles) with an estimate of 50 minutes. More people were charging in the north area, so I speculated that the locals might know they are higher powered and faster?  But it is also by the first entrance where it isn’t visible yet until you round the corner forms the second entrance. The Tesla navigator strangely takes you clear past the are to the last and third entrance. So if you have been there before you know that. If not you instinctively turn at the middle entrance as the chargers are visible and quite apparent. I suggest multiple improvements to the Tesla website so you can locate chargers with restaurants, hotels and popular  sites. When we travel long distances, that is most convenient and after a trip to Colorado, I learned it is best to plan your trip that way and stay at hotel or eat at a restaurant with a destination charger that is free and convenient."
Great location next to a friendly social bar and grill and an awesome mall. A few minutes from 408 and further to I-4. Close to UCF and LOTS of shops and other activities as well as the executive airport. About 10 miles to Universal and City Walk. The bar staff s open late with nice restrooms and other amenities.  A mile or so to WAWA and cheap fast food. One of my favorite super chargers
Great location next to a Meijer grocery store and a lot of restaurants within walking distance. Also a decent patch of grass and shade if you just want to stretch and sit in the grass!
"Great location next to Meijer, peak 250Kw charger. 12 stalls. Located next to the pharmacy side of Meijer and Bank of America"
"Great location next to the walkable shops and restaurants of Idaho Springs.  Check out the Westbound and Down Brewery and Restaurant for great coffee, food, and nice restrooms."
Great location off the highway near many places to eat.  Only McAlister's and Meijer within walking distance but pretty much anything else a short drive away.
Great location on service station and clean area. not that occupied..
Great location right by the mall and target.
"Great location right near the Target entrance featuring V3 Supercharging speeds at every spot, even if another Tesla is next to you."
Great location right of I 65 Lebanon.
"Great location right off 101, and the outlets and surrounding restaurants provide plenty of options for things to do while stopped. Bathrooms located at the outlets, or across the street at the Jack in the Box."
"Great location right off 95, at a Sheetz with relatively clean bathrooms and decent food and drink selections. Also right next to a Panera bread for additional food selections. Overall great location."
"Great location right off I-10 in the Target parking lot. There is also a Wendy’s and Taco Bell as well as a Marshalls, Ross, and Five Below."
"Great location right off the 87 freeway, and helpful because it's kind of out in the middle of nowhere. Also right in the middle of a shopping center in case you need food & supplies on your trip."
Great location right off the highway before entering Page.  Bathrooms in the Hotel are very nice.
Great location right off the highway.
Great location right off the highway. Check out Cowpoke Cafe right across the rail tracks while you charge.
"Great location that can charge at 250kW. This is tucked away from high traffic which means no one is going to ICE these charger. The rest stop has convenient amenities such as Starbucks, and Auntie Ann’s. Also has a trash bin nearby!"
"Great location to charge and eat!!! The plaza has a lot options, but what I loved is that you can eat at the Texas Steakhouse Loon and get 20% off. Friends staff a good food. The chargers are old one and kinda slow but by the time you are done eating you are good to go."
Great location to charge heading out of the cities.
"Great location to charge quickly while on a quick trip between SF and South Bay! Just a hop from 101. Huge and well lit parking lot, doesn’t feel isolated even late nights!"
"Great location to charge south of Houston. Rudy’s BBQ is in the parking lot, the food is good and the bathrooms are always clean. Academy sports is within walking distance and can occupy some moments while you charge. I’ve never been here when it’s completely full and I always get a quick charge."
Great location to charge up but can be super busy at times. Remember there is another spot in garage if this is too busy.
Great location to charge your car. You can take a walk while charging
Great Location when Collin Street Bakery is open.  Closed at 6pm.  Had to settle for a Subway sandwich.
"Great location while traveling 29. Easy on/off highway. Clean area on the side of the Hilton, which has a restaurant/bar inside. Chargers are V2, 150kW, which is all you are going to find in WI as of now. Plenty decent speeds for your needs."
"Great location with a gas station, Dunkin, and Denny’s all within walking distance."
"Great location with big grocery store. Short drive to mc Donald's, Arby's, taco bell, Caribou, Starbucks, Denny's, Wendy's etc"

Great location with lots of restaurants
Great location with plenty of food options and fast 250kW charging!

Great location within walking distance to lots of shops
"Great location,  but very dirty,  half the charges handles were just thrown on ground...."
"Great location, big restaurant."
"Great location, clean and safe. Fast charger not busy."
"Great location, clean, fast, and the grocery store is very nice as well."
"Great location, convenient to interstate, clean restrooms!  Only there’s an issue with the positioning of red concrete posts which prevents charging if you are towing anything (like bikes).  We had to pull in parallel and take up 2 spaces.  This thankfully wasn’t a high usage charger so we were able to charge without inconveniencing others.  Keep this in mind when you choose the “sideway” chargers (often there’s at least one).  Try to only use when needed…like when you are towing."
"Great location, easily accessible and next to a restaurant if you want to eat while charging"
"Great location, end of mall parking lot. Red lobster, Olive garden, and Texas roadhouse ridiculously close by!"
"Great location, high power (150 kw, so our model S was drawing 120 kw, but that will vary based upon your state of charge)... not too busy, 5/5 would charge again.

Update, May 2021: Now that Trader Joe's has opened right by the supercharger, it is even better."
"Great location, just slower at 150kw rate."
"Great location, market with clean restrooms nearby."
"Great location, nice and clean.  Sheetz has great road trip food."
"Great location, Nice little lake, Very nice hotel"
"Great location, right next to a WAWA station, TacoBell, McDonalds next door!"
"Great location, right off the highway. Clean bathrooms in Sheetz with good food options within walking distance."
"Great Location, Security Guard Help me with my Tesla when I arrived in a Tow truck."

"Great Location, Slots are free Most of the time.  Good Charging Speeds"
"Great location, there are plenty of charges and lots of stores and restaurants nearby."
"Great location, well lit area.  It is right behind Lucilles diner and there is a truck stop across the street."
"Great location: restaurants,  shops. It was clean both times when we passed. I particularly like this charging station for its speed."
Great location!  Shop or dine while you charge!
Great location! Has a ton of shopping and restaurants within walking distance while you wait for your Tesla to get a full charge!
Great location! It's just off the freeway behind Oxford Suites. There are a couple restaurants right next to it but if you walk South and cross overland you will find better options. There's a small patch of grass where you can let your dog out and stretch their legs. And a restroom downstairs in the hotel or walk over to Lowe's.
"Great location! Panera, Buffalo Wild Wings, Noodles and Co, Coldstone! Short walks to these great dining and snack places while you charge. It can get busy."
Great location! Right next to the hotel that I’m staying in.
"Great location! Store offers everything you’d need from snacks and drinks, to clean bathrooms!"
Great location! Walking distance to Meijer and McDonalds. And the Meijer is pretty big so you won't feel the time passing when you shop or look around while waiting to charge.
"Great location.
V3. 8 stalls.
Semi easy off of rt 38 and rt 70 to/From Philly.
Quick shaded walk to Wawa. About 50feet.
Wlak to few other shopping/eateries in area."
Great location.  Get inside the Healthy Living for great products and some nice microbrew!
Great location.  No one there at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday...love road tripping during the off season!
Great location.  Plenty of stores to visit. Please consider adding more chargers.
"Great location.  Stopped here on our first roadtrip.  No wait to plug in.  Grabbed lunch at City BBQ, right next door (recommend).  Car was ready to go within minutes of us getting back."
"Great location. 12x 150kW Tesla stalls including one that is forward drive in. Location is within a huge parking lot so there is no reason for others to park in the futher away spots that are Tesla EV charging spots.
There are many stores of all kinds around including:
Very close:
McDonald's that is open for 20 hours everyday, from: 5am to 1am.
CVS open 24/7 with its pharmacy open now at more limited hours. Has the ONLY bathrooms that are open 24/7!
Bathrooms are located at the most LEFT corridor at the very FAR end. You will see the light brown door at the far end.
Chase bank, Verizon store and many more.
Further away there is a large Stop and Shop supermarket that is open 7am to 12midnight.
No hotels very nearby."
Great location. But this needs to be updated to v3. One of the busiest. They are always at full capacity and the charging speeds are terrible.
Great location. Clean Casey’s with excellent lighting at the chargers.
"Great location. Clean, well lit area; I felt very safe. It wasn’t too crowded when I went at 7pm on a Saturday."
"Great location. Close to shopping. 8 Stalls in an open parking (park/ride) lot.
As this is the only Supercharger from Mammoth lakes to Yosemite Valley Center, It would have been excellent if the charging speed was more. I hope Tesla will upgrade soon."
Great location. Coop store and gas station near by as well electric charger for other EVs. A bit off the Hwy though.
"Great location. Hy-Vee has everything you could ever need, and there are a few full service restaurants nearby too. Worth a stop from I-80 or you're heading to or from Chicago from Peoria."
Great location. Large Starbucks in Safeway nearby. Super Fast 215kW for a Model Y.
Great location. Lots of food options near by.
"Great location. Needs upkeep. 2 stalls are down and need cables replaced.
Due to the corner location, lots of trash and debris blow in to the lot…

Safe, fast enough, plenty to do while you charge."
Great location. Not a lot of dining and no directly nearby convenience store options. Clean bathroom at adjacent Comfort Inn.
"Great location. Passcode to lounge is an awesome perk! Wifi, coffee/tea, water, tv!! Clean bathrooms and even some kids toys"
"Great location. Right of Interstate. Two restaurants and a coffee shop right there. Many fast food places and a convenience store right across the street.
The shopping mall next door is more or less closed, hardly any stores left in there.
There is one car wash behind the gas station across the street and another one just up the street on the same side.
The charger can fill up in the summer time but I have not had to wait ever to get a stall at this location."
Great location. Right off the turnpike.
"Great location. Super convenient right next to  HyVee super market (w/Wahlburgers), and Buffalo Wild Wings. Charging speed was surprisingly snappy for 120kW."
Great location. There is a lot of stores right by the chargers.
Great location. There is a nice strip mall with lots of food options. Southbound the exit comes right up to the superchargers. Northbound exit takes you to the other side of the strip mall so you have to drive to the right side. No biggie.
Great location. This was close to I-75 highway. There is a Meijer grocery store and Target w/ a Starbucks close by.  There is also an Olive Garden that is a few minutes walk down the parking lot.
"Great location. Tons of food, stores and the charge rate was 90+ kw. Chik fill a within easy walking distance in addition to many other places to grab a bite. This location surpasses the Glen Allen supercharger."
Great location. We love Bucee's!!!!
Great location. Whenever headed to the city or returning I stop by to top off. Plus I’m a target location couldn’t had asked for a better one
Great location... Right behind Panera bread....although this is not obvious.
Great location.The chargers are located in the cvs parking lot. Would definitely use this location again.
"Great locations right off the highway. Hotels, restaurants, and gas stations within walking distance."
"Great mix of dining options. However, your chest will charge faster than you can eat your food."
Great new addition
Great new place to charge and fuel up on drinks and food.
"Great new supercharger. About 24 spaces, right next to circle k with toilets and coffee and plenty gas station food, right on highway 89, opposite the KOA campsite."
"Great new Superchargers. Thank you Elon Musk and Tesla!!!
Google Maps correction: it's 250 kW, not 120.
Another note: other Superchargers stations are either 150 kW or the newer 250 kW"
"Great night lighting. Somewhat nearby 24 hr grocery store for restrooms. Has a few walkable food options but not a large selection, similarly some nearby shopping. Grass where pets can relieve themselves. No nearby trash cans for emptying out your car, and if it's raining you would absolutely need an umbrella to visit anything near this charger since it's in the middle of a large parking lot"
Great one. Bathrooms 24/7. Love Buc-ee's
Great open space. 6 total chargers in the gas station parking lot. Walking distance to some eating spots.
Great option to charge @ The Collection mall area. Not too far away from Starbucks.
Great parking. Not directly off the freeway but close. In walking distance of food and restrooms.
Great place
Great place
"Great place and clean, I know it can't all be perfect but it would have been lovely if restroom, snacks, etc were closer. There's a Loves across the street but since both are at the back end of their respective lots it's just far enough away to be inconvenient"
Great place but a little walking distance from food. It's best to bring the food and eat in the car while you charge
Great place for a 10kW charge. Needs EV signage. Half the spots (2 are Tesla) were ICED
"Great place for a Supercharger … unless you’re traveling Northbound.

At rest stop on I476S. Restrooms, restaurants, and pet area. Clean and several chargers.

Disappointing that it’s  hard to find /access from Northbound 476 and along way out of the way to backtrack and get back on I476N and/or I80.

Why isn’t there a Supercharger at Hickory Run / intersection of I476 and I 80?"
"Great place for a Tesla supercharging station. There's good options for food, and the supercharging location is a boost to local vendors. We picked up a large pizza from Vinny's for dinner while the car was plugged in. A win-win!"
"Great place for chargers: big mall, restaurants - food court and restrooms on second floor. Here’s the view from the food court to the chargers."
"Great place for Tesla super super charger!  I visited 3 Buc-ee’s Super Charger locations in a week. Leed’s AL near Birmingham, Robertsdale,AL near mobile and Adairsville GA."
"Great place for Tesla's in other electrical vehicles. If you are in a quick pinch for some charge, fast charging depends on how many people are in the ports. The more people, the less charge, the less people. The more charge there is a store outlet nearby with at least 20 plus stores and most of the stores are either food close. Comedies or other things that you can buy would recommend going here if you want to go get some stuff while you're Tesla or other car is charging"
Great place if your about to have to walk otherwise look for somewhere  else ! Equivalent of watching paint dry
Great place it's A Wawa so good convince store with most of your needs as far as food and drinks not auto parts
"Great place the employees are great help. They are having some problems with the breaker tripping, something is not quite right it's a 100amp breakers that pops over a long period of time. I'm making this in hope someone can help them they have said no one is taking them seriously to help get it fixed. So far if you see this set your tesla charge amps to 30 at the max"
Great place to chaege up. Restaurants in the mall of all types. Market Basket within walking distance to allow quick shopping before heading home.
Great place to charge & you can smoke by these pumps 😂😮‍💨
Great place to charge and eat!
Great place to charge around Fort Davis and Marfa. Not many other charging spots around this area. Hotel was accommodating even if one didn't stay there (we stayed across the road)
Great place to charge but the lot smells like pee as soon as you step out of your car. Smh! They could also use some garbage cans. There is so much garbage thrown all over. Other than that I got a great charge.
Great place to charge if you’re in the area. No fee for parking here is a huge perk and hard to find in NYC. Charger i used only went up to 113kW. I was hoping for the full 250 for a super fast charge. Nonetheless it’s a cool spot.
Great place to charge in large outdoor mall. Chargers are towards the back of the Target parking lot. Not too far of I-85
Great place to charge there is usually a charger open every time we go.
Great place to charge while at the Marriott. The2nd tesla charger was not working .
Great place to charge while doing a bit of shopping or have a beer at the brewery.
Great place to charge while shopping at the Pleasant Prairie Outlet Mall. I’ve never had to wait for a charger which are in the parking lot of the mall near the Nike Outlet & across the street from the Doubletree Hotel.  A few minutes walk to the mall’s public restrooms which are only open during mall hours.  5 minutes to the small food court that also has restrooms.  If you have time while in the area I highly recommend the Hobnob Supper Club for dinner or Wells Brothers pizza in nearby Racine.  If you only have a few minutes to spare…Mars Cheese Castle can give you a “taste” of Wisconsin …and perhaps some grins as it’s a “build it and they will come” experience.
"Great place to charge your Tesla in the Finger Lakes! Wieners, burgers and fries were excellent while waiting for a charge!"
"Great place to charge your Tesla or any other EV. Stop, charge, shop, or dine at the Estero Miromar Outlets just a short distance from the charging stations."
Great place to charge your tesla. While also going to the store and getting your groceries. The only downfall is they need to put more in. Because It tends to get filled up fast over the weekend with longer waiting times.
"Great place to charge, 8 stalls at 150kW, currently .31 cents a kWh. It is downtown and there are shops and food readily available. There are public free rest rooms in the center of town within the park."
"Great place to charge, I've never had to wait for a stall here. Bathroom is available during business hours or across the street at restaurants & hotel."
"Great place to charge, next to costco. Can be busy on the weekend as there's only 6 chargers."
Great place to charge! Fun fact: Meijer has coffee and a donut for $1 back in the bakery section. Bring cash.
Great place to charge! Many stores to walk to.
"Great place to charge.  Management told me there was no fee for use of the Tesla destination charger.  Very generous since we were only charging while we ate at Cracker Barrel.  29 mph  Tesla M3.

Additional comment:  not sure why, but after about an hour of charging it dropped to 0 mph.  Still free, though."
Great place to charge. Even a few visitors while charging to make the time dissappear.
"Great place to charge. Grocery store and Starbucks are right there.
Very safe area."
"Great place to charge. HUGE store with tourist stuff, lots of room, 4 chargers, clean bathrooms and windshield washers next to chargers. Highly recommend."
"Great place to charge. I Charge up first with a Charged Lemonade at Panera Bread at Park Lane. Then, the car gets a charge at this Tesla Supercharger, only a few blocks from my apartment in The Village."
Great place to charge. I took a walk along the lakeshore and enjoyed watching the chickens run around in their pen while I charged up.
Great place to charge. It 150kw max charging speed and there are food & drinks nearby!
Great place to fill up the electrons while browsing the beer selection at Meijer. Aldi is nearby as well
"Great place to get iced out if you're a Tesla owner and need to supercharge. This has been happening for years. Post a negative review about HyVee, maybe that'll help."
"Great Place to grab a charge and a bite to eat.

Stores near by are very welcoming.

I didn’t see it but I heard there is even a sign welcoming Tesla drivers."
"Great place to park your Tesla to go to the Outlets. It doesn’t get too full, and if it does, there are other EV chargers in front of it.

Some of the charger hooks are broken so you have to be real gentle when placing it back so it doesn’t fall and break.

Location: behind the outlet mall."
Great place to recharge when heading up north from the Twin Cities or back. Plenty of open stalls any time I've stopped there and you can do a quick pit stop and leg stretch in the nearby casino.
"Great place to rest, super charge and head back out! Loving #Tesla."
Great place to shop it's a huge one level mall and even greater for Tesla owners to know about..huge charging bank..124kwh...must be 30 chargers maybe more
Great place to stop and charge 👍
Great place to stop and charge quickly and get some great food and snacks from Buc-ee’s! Chargers are at the beginning entrance heading towards the back right side of the building.
Great place to stop and take a walk or have a picnic
Great place to stop and use the restroom and grab a snack while you charge up! There is plenty of grassy area for pets to be walked as well. It is a busy spot though so sometimes it charges slower. Currently at 25kW. The convenience store is super clean and well stocked!
Great place to stop since there is coffee nearby and McDonald's. Its really sad we see people vandalize the superchargers.
"Great place to stop with kids- they have a climbing play area, free Ferris wheel, candy store AND arcade inside Sheels. There is a cafe for coffee, sandwiches and fudge.  Bathrooms are right near the entrance which was easy.  They also had animated presidents (and non-animated), toy store, a giant fish tank. They also have a home furnishings/gift area. Something for everyone - kept us busy during the charge."
"Great place to stop, has an amazing view."
"Great place to stop! Version 3 charger with all the amenities. The charger is in the gas station parking lot so you have a convenience store (very clean and well kept) with a cute little shop, a sit down restaurant (with very good food), and fast food grab and go options. The only thing it’s missing is a coffee shop if you don’t want gas station coffee."
Great place to stop. Easy charging and good market.
"Great place to super charge. I was able to go shopping get a pair of glasses from Hip Optical and buy a new iPhone from Verizon by the time my car had charged.

Please note the chargers on on the SECOND FLOOR. Regular EV chargers on the first Floor."
"Great place to supercharge, went to Applebee's across the street for lunch."
"Great place to Supercharge. Pride has serval food choices to choose from, restroom and wifi too"
Great place to wait while you and your car recharge
Great place with Sheetz to do some quick snacks.
Great place! Many stations. A few things to do while you wait. The only downside is that you have to travel to get here.... it is too far from other super chargers.... we need more of these
"Great place! They have trash cans and also windshield squeegee at the supercharger. No need to look for one. Also in a gas station that's pretty big with clean bathrooms.

150KW"
Great place. Multiple working chargers. Gas station restroom  not very clean.   Dog park on site but was dirty. Walked around making sure nothing bad for dogs. Did give us an opportunity to let pups stretch there legs.
Great place. There is a DD next door for some snacks.
Great plugs and shiny equipment. I see some other places (not Tesla) with plugs in the dirt. It's funny but sad.
"Great restaurant URBANE CAFE is right next to charging area and they have some awesome healthy salads, bowls and sandwiches.....great stop if you want some healthy, tasty eats!"
Great services. All áreas are very clean. Confortable room. Congratulations!
Great set of Superchargers. Grabbed a bite at Jersey Mike’s and charging completed just as we finished. Consider going west to 45 then Mopac if headed North into Austin. We found that much better than getting back on I-35.
"Great setup, nearby Starbucks, Pizza, Dutch Bros, and Taco Bell."
"Great shopping center including a pho restaurant and a wonderful cafe called Rothem cafe, they made us great sandwiches and cappuccinos to boot, would gladly stop here again"
"Great speed (250kw) with access to entire mall, Target, and food places.Weird placement of chargers in alignment to parking spaces made the reach tight, but that seems like small potatoes."
Great speed and access to gas station store and fast food
Great speed and amazing food
"Great speed, but not that great of a location. Almost no food options in the near side of the mall, which means lots of walking."
"Great speed, right off the highway, but bathroom is in the far back of a grocery store and it feels like you’re invading the employees’ break area."
Great spot and conveniently located inside the garage. One day they did not charge me the 10.00 parking fee and the next day they did.
Great spot and thanks to Tesla for keeping one here for great tourist spot at Mackinac island ferry company
Great spot close to the highway
"Great spot for a charger! Would give 5 stars if there was a public restroom within walking distance. It does however have food options for sandwiches, smoothies, tacos and more (Smoothie King, Which Wich, Red Robin, and Chipotle) as well as plenty of grass to let out the dogs and a tons of sidewalks all over if you need to stretch you legs. The Superchargers are located in a shopping center so there’s plenty to see and do if you’re not pressed for time. Really also liked how safe and clean this area was. Closest trash bins are next to Which Wich."
"Great spot for a Supercharger. Plenty of grass, to let out your dogs and a good amount of stores for snacks and a quick bite nearby including Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, a gas station, and Sonic. Nearest trash bum is located at the Outback. Would have given 5 stars if bathrooms and fast food were within walking distance."
"Great spot for a V3 supercharger if you're traveling through I-41. The Woodman's as of this review (12/16/2021) closes at 11pm, so keep that in mind if traveling through here at night."
Great spot for supercharging. Right next to Safeway and a lot of shade. There is an Ace hardware close to it as well.
"Great spot in Birmingham. Located in a Greenwise Grocery parking lot, the Mountainbrook retail center has several restaurants and boutiques to help pass the time. Also, the superchargers here are pretty fast."
Great spot located in parking lot of Hampton Inn. Stopped at around 0800 and there was only 1 other person there. Starbucks/mcds within walking distance restrooms at both places. Trash can placed outside of exterior door of Hampton in for use.
"Great spot next to a giant Shell, directly off highway."
Great spot off the highway. We went to whole foods to grab a quick bite. Speed was good and all 6 stalls were free.
Great spot to charge off the beaten path. You’ll need to head past The Inn and take a right before the tasting room to find this one.
Great spot to charge on your way back from Starbase!
"Great spot to charge the car and yourself. Nice little shops to browse, a museum, and a very good cafe for takeout along with a buffet. I was happy to have found this on my trip across the area."
Great spot to charge up for a while on Austin! The chargers are located on the back side of the hotel. So far I've never seen anyone else while I've been there so there isn't any worry they'll all be taken.
Great spot to charge up! We charged our car while having brunch at the French cafe within walking distance. We did not have any issues pulling into the spots but will say it’s indeed a very tight fit!
Great spot to charge up. Clean restrooms and Subway inside the gas station market which is very big. One of the stalls here was broken on our last trip. Someone tore up the cable.
Great spot to charge up. Fast chargers and some local businesses within walking distance. Being new and in a rural area there’s not much in the way of traffic either.
"Great spot to charge while you shop for some groceries. Decent chargers, decent rate as well. A little bit higher than in Evanston. Clean well kept area."
"Great spot to charge, with lots of stalls. Lots of places to choose from to eat as well. It is only about 5 minutes off of i75 to get here."
"Great spot to charge! No food, but restrooms in the hotel!"
Great spot to charge.
"Great spot to charge. Keep in mind cold weather charging is slower, so plan accordingly."
Great spot to park and charge while you visit nearby bars or restaurants. They also have a couple of the home charging stations for free I'd you plan to be out for awhile.
"Great spot to stop, used Lowe’s for bathroom
Since Panera closed their restrooms."
"Great spot, all 12 chargers working and vacant on a Thursday afternoon in October. Stores, food nearby"
"Great spot, but the chargers definitely need some love…"
"Great spot, with 12 stalls, in a shopping area that includes a Target and Harris Teeter."
Great spot! Grabbed a quick drink and poutine at the bar and was 100% by the time I got back. Nice to see 250kW chargers being installed in this area of Canada.
Great spot! Lots of food/ bathroom options. I'm and out in 10 min on way back down to Denver!
Great spot! We got over 150KW here and is nice safe spot. Had lunch on way to Texas and then donuts on way back from Texas - both eateries have coffee and restrooms unless you arrive during hours they are closed.
"Great spot. 14-16 Chargers, lots of availability and the mall us huge."
"Great spot. A bit harder to find on the tesla navigation system but easier to find on google maps. Black bear dinner, gas stations, and a nice view of the mountains."
Great spot. Courtyard and best Western next door. Starbucks closest with other fast-food. Panera bread is .2m
Great spot. Gen 2 chargers that share with the adjacent car. Decent charging rate when not full or at least sharing with others. Waited for 5 cars on a Sunday afternoon.
"Great spot. Last turbo charge on way to Yosemite from the south. Walk up to the pavilion/resort for restrooms, water refills, gift shop etc"
Great spot. Love that it's next to the gas station
Great spot… but busy
"Great station ⛽ right off the highway, stopped for 10 minutes on our trip from long island to Ithaca. Peaked at 252 kw. Lots of CCS chargers available for non teslas. There is a dog 🐕 park right next to the station, we let our pup run around while we juiced up ⚡"
Great station for charging.  It would be nice if they had 2 or 4 more chargers for when it gets busy.  Also great to be able to get a bite to eat in the Rudy's BBQ in the same parking lot while charging.
"Great station with 250kw charging. The Sheetz has good food to eat, bathrooms are always clean and they have a station with squeegee fir the superchargers. The parking lot is always clean. Wish their wifi had a bit stronger signal."
"Great station. 250kW, super easy I-80 access, and in the parking lot of Raleys. Excellent!"
Great stop 8 stalls one for trailer equipped. Plenty of room. Lots of near by stores and dining. Just off of I10
"Great stop at the Flying J and super charger.  The super charger had a squeegie for the windshields, a trashcan and papertowels. That's a lot more than other places we're stopped."
"Great stop at the Parker’s Garage gas station and eatery. They have some hot bar food: chicken, fish, mac & cheese. Clean restrooms. Starbucks within walking distance and a big Costco 200 yards away"
Great stop for Tesla vehicles. Located in HyVee parking lot.  Lots of food and rest stop choices.
Great stop in Grenada. I like gas station food. What can I say.
"Great stop on our trip from Cincinnati to Asheville. Super fast charging and with so many stalls we had our own stall. Lots of food and coffee options including Chick-fil-A and Chuy's. Also, it's in the the Meijer parking lot which is convenient for snacks etc. Meijer is stepping up their game with chargers but there's also a Target if that's more your speed."
"Great stop to top up. Read a book, look out at the lake while you charge. A big solar array on the property looks to be powering this charging station."
"Great stop with things to do.  Nail salon, massage, PetSmart, poke bowl, Wendy’s, smoothie, pink berry.   Ave. .43 kw.  9 stations.  Often available. 👍🏻"
"Great stop, has a great McDonald's nearby, we got carryout and within 20mins of pulling in to the 250kw station we were already on our way! Actually took us longer to eat than charge so we ended up charging more than we needed to, even better for our road trip.

There's also a Wawa nearby for any small things you may need, and the stalls were all empty in the morning. Great stop for any road trip if you are coming by this way, it's right off the highway, low traffic, friendly people, very fast charging, and good amenities right there next to you."
"Great stop, working chargers, next to a gas station, clean restrooms, dog park area next to the gas station."
Great stop!  Pull in for easy charging! Fast & easy access into Casey’s.
"Great stop. A little ways off the highway, but a peaceful place to charge. Picnic Tables, a swing set, and a shady grass area to relax while you charge. Pizza place next door is open after 5pm or walk a half mile to the Covered Wagon Café, which is delicious!"
Great stop. Buc-ees is nice. Chargers are a bit out there as parking lot is huge so note it is a long walk to get inside.
Great stop. Convenient. Saw during a busy weekend charging capacity was limited to 80% charge rate. Something to be aware of
Great stop. Nice close shopping and good home cooking.
Great stop. Sheetz and Walmart within walking distance. Clean restrooms. Good selection of food and healthy snacks.
Great stop. Tons of chargers. Good restrooms. Mini grocery store inside.
"Great strategic location! Whole foods, other stores, restaurants, starbucks, 5 min. walking to the mall! I was surprised to see someone leaving a 3 star review because ice cars parked there!? It's like leaving a bad review to a restaurant because someone parked bad in the parking lot!"
Great super charger easy to find and surrounded by plenty of food and things to do.
Great super charger located next to interstate. The gas station is very clean and staff is very friendly. Location feels safe and well illuminated.
Great super charger with plenty of stations!
Great super charger! Nice location and is a little hidden which is nice because you won’t need to worry about anyone hurting ur precious Tesla f
Great super charger.  Just 6 miles south of the main touristy part of Sedona.
Great super charger. Has the new 250 kind so you'll charge faster than the regular ones.
Great super charger. Never had an issue here. Will see how it goes as the summer season fares on. Also the Stop and Shop is great!
Great super charger..wish it was near Towne center
"Great super charging experience at 250 kW, and the chargers and parking spots are ideally aligned. Pricey at $0.40 kWh but worth the faster speed. As with many Wawa chargers, you are in the back of the parking lot, but there is a nice big grass area that's great for dogs and humans to stretch their legs.
One downside was the lack of any trashcan near the chargers... And a bit of trash all over the place."
Great super charging location with several places to grab a quick bite while the car charges.
Great Super Charging Station.  Use Google Maps to find it versus the Tesla GPS.
Great super fast 250 KW charger at the Wawa.
"Great supercharge! I usually have to stop here when traveling to Galveston from Houston when visiting family or showing a home and don’t have time to preplan. Super fast and convenient. Clean and easy to locate. I recommend this charging station. You can even get BBQ if you’re hungry, while waiting."
"Great supercharger but not much to do within walking distance. There's an Ameristar casino but they won't allow anyone in under 21, not even got bathrooms. However, they told us that we could walk around the building, there's another entrance and you can take your kids there to use the restrooms."
"Great supercharger just off of I84 and easily accessible going west or east. 250 kW peak changing. Museum ($5pp) and Oregon Welcome Center (free) in shared building; when closed, there is a portable toilet available. Dog relief area also nearby. Perfect spot!"
"Great supercharger just off of I84 and easily accessible going west or east. 250 kW peak changing. Museum ($5pp) and Oregon Welcome Center (free) in shared building; when closed, there is a portable toilet available. Dog relief area also nearby. Perfect spot!"
"Great Supercharger location - in the same lot as  a large Hy-Vee grocery store and restaurant.  12 charging stations available, with plenty of room."
"Great supercharger location, easy to get to from the highway. The charging stalls are dedicated ""Tesla"" only. Although rated as up to 150kW, I've only managed 60kW (even with empty neighbouring stalls). The adjacent Holiday Inn Express is a great hotel and next door to that is the Black Bear Restaurant."
Great supercharger location! Located beside Meijer and some great food choices. Dragon City is about a month old and has fantastic Chinese food; trust me you will not be disappointed!
"Great supercharger location! Most stalls in-use midday, but all available mid to late morning. Few shops and restaurants nearby to enjoy while juicing up before getting to Yosemite :)"
Great supercharger location! There are 8 stalls behind the sheetz building near the drive through entrance. Chargers are new and about half of them are open at the time I was here.
"Great supercharger location. Easy to get to, safe and clean. Just enough time to get a slice of pizza at the original NY pizza shop nearby. Delicious."
"Great Supercharger location. Fast charging (I've had between 70 and 120kW), rarely gets crowded.
ACME grocery store is very good and convenient, there's some restaurants, bank, donuts and other amenities.
The turn into the mall coming from the South through traffic can be tricky.
Super close to I-287 and a car wash."
Great supercharger lots of shops around it and places to eat
"Great Supercharger next to HyVee and many other food spots, etc. It’s fast but not as fast as the SuperChargers in Olathe for instance. Nicer HyVee though. Besides latest upgrade to Tesla software allows us to watch Netflix, HuluPlus, YouTube and Tesla tutorial videos while in park. Charging time passes easier than ever!"
Great Supercharger next to HyVee. Fastest Supercharger around!
Great Supercharger place! Spacious and located on a big plaza.
Great Supercharger station with off-peak rates. Empty in the mornings and there is a Dunkin Donuts right across.
Great supercharger stop. Plenty of room to back into the chargers. Lots to do in the truck stop with a food court and shopping available.
Great supercharger with 16 charging stations. Right at bucees parking lot.
"Great Supercharger with a good truck stop next door that has quite a few food options, fast or slow. Restrooms inside the truck stop are good. There is also a family bathroom which really helped out for changing our baby's diaper."
"Great supercharger with fast recharge times and plenty of stalls. Located within walking distance to a Panera and a Starbucks, so easy to grab a bite to eat while you wait for your charge."
"Great supercharger with multiple food options (Panda Express, McDonald's, Pizza the Hutt, for instance) and lots of fast stalls. Not too far out of the way. It could use a bit of service since some of the tabs broke off and the charger cables often fall down. I strongly prefer going here over charging in downtown."
Great Supercharger with only one other car here 😀 skipped the south Flagstaff charger and came here hoping for much faster charging 👍
Great supercharger with several geocaches nearby
"Great Supercharger!
Lookp for Holiday Inn then turn at restaurant sign and you will see it.  Bathrooms in Holiday.  You may use side entrance by drive up bank teller.  Beautiful church bells ringing"
Great supercharger! DakotaMart is a great place to stop for food and supplies.
Great supercharger! Lots of spots and not busy! Super fast stop! Thank you!
"Great Supercharger! Nearby:
Wawa
McDonald’s
TacoBell"
Great supercharger.  Conveniently located off I-81 and in a shopping center with a number of food options and very fast charging speed!
"Great Supercharger.  Level 3 - 250KW.  Next to Starbucks and in the parking lot of a Panera.  We've used it several times, whether as the last charge before Destin or the first when leaving Destin.  Never been more than a few cars charging at a time.  Very close to I-10."
"Great Supercharger.  Plenty of food to eat.  Stop by the Waffle House, they have good food, great customer service, and very nice staff.  I’ve stopped at this charging station several times and never had a problem."
"Great supercharger. Back of the target parking lot, lots of room, easy to find."
Great supercharger. Easy to use and work.
Great supercharger. I have never had to wait for a charge and have only ran into a charging issue once.
"Great supercharger. It is in the Meijer parking lot. Charges at 100 kWt. We bought a couple things we needed after leaving Kings Island while charging. It is well lit, easy to get to and convenient. McDonalds and other places are reasonably close also."
Great supercharger. Super fast and next to Sonic and Burger King! Can’t stop for long at these 250kW charger. No one was there when we went.
Great supercharger. Very clean and well-kept. Trash cans were available and not overflowing. Chargers appeared to be in good shape. I was the only one charging here when I stopped but Charger 1B was fast and worked great. Often stop here on my frequent trips to St. Louis and haven't ever had any issues.
"Great Supercharger. Very fast charging. I added 100 miles of range to my Tesla M3 in 15 minutes.

The Supercharger was easy to locate in the parking lot. There were plenty of available slots.

As usual, the Supercharging experience was seamless and convenient."
"Great Superchargers located at the iconic Buc-ee's in New Braunfels.  Buc-ees's is always a must stop and the addition of these 24 250kW chargers makes it very convenient.  You'll easily spend enough time in Buc-ee's to get a full charge.  From all the merchandise, food, snacks, voted cleanest restrooms, etc...plug in and pass the time.

As far as the chargers, all are 250 kW and parking spots are very spacious.  They're located on the access road in front of Buc-ee's."
"Great supercharging location with stalls in the parking garage. Easy access, food options and restrooms nearby."
"Great supercharging locations.  Plenty of stalls, near  a Costco and other shopping options. I have never had to wait"
Great supercharging station. It’s located on the parking lot of a gas station with a Sonic and a bbq restaurant. Great place to take the EV.
"Great Tesla charger in with Sheetz in a good area. Make the usual “pit stop”, grab a quick bite, and you should be charged back up in no time. I wish they’d add another charger near Boone or Banner Elk though."
Great Tesla charger it’s better then national grids.
"Great Tesla charger, Pride gas station is meh.  Would be nice to have some quality food."
Great tesla stop if you have a dog. The sonic has a dog park right next to it. The only downside to this stop is no middle of the night bathrooms
"Great Tesla Supercharger located in Oakland Park, FL. WaWa for the added bonus !"
"Great Tesla Supercharger location that offers fast chargers, a good choice of charge points, and plenty of room if you are towing a trailer. We were lucky and were able to pull straight into a charger slot, but if that wasn’t possible there was room to drop your trailer."
Great Tesla supercharger location. There are 11 spots and very open. My only knock would be not that many great food options in walking distance. Doing a long distance trip and stopped to charge up and grab lunch. There is the Meijer with a Starbucks inside. There is a Wendy's and White Castle across the street and a McDonald's down the road.
"Great that another Meijer has added a Tesla supercharger in my book. Come here a lot during the warmer months, lots of food choices if you're okay with walking a few minutes.
Heads up though, night can get interesting. I advise against charging here alone after dark."
Great to charger your vehicle while you're visiting Holiday World
"Great to finally get a Supercharger in Boone!  Drove from Raleigh direct and charged at 248kW for around 5-10 minutes, then it started slowly tapering. Charged from 14% to 87% in around 20-25 minutes. (2018 Model 3 RWD Long Range)"
"Great to finally have superchargers in Boca Raton, even if they are slightly out of the way on the second floor of one of the parking garages in the Town Center, within minutes of the I-95."
"Great to have a charger in Baltimore! Only hits 72kW max so will take a bit longer to charge. Inside Harris Teeter parking garage with plenty of garage lighting. HT has a Starbucks, a restroom, and a small salad and pasta bar. In a good part of town, we had no safety concerns."
Great to have a Supercharging station in Lake Arrowhead village. 8 charging stations with 250KWH (approx 400mph speed). Very convenient with shopping and restaurants around. The Tesla Supercharger sign board was not displayed at the entrance of the Village. (There is Upper and lower level entrance for the Village). It took 20mins to figure out the exact location. Have to enter the Lower level entrance of the village and the supercharger was located on the 3rd floor of the covered parking lot.
Great to have so many new chargers on the water! 12 and only 3 occupied.  Good location convenient to tons of stores and dining from Cosi to Long horn steakhouse even a Red Robin for the kids.
Great to see in the Forks!
Great to see the business that has the chargers (Hy-Vee) has placed a trash recepticle along with windshield cleaner at the chargers.
Great unique place to stop..lots of gifts and great food. Tesla superchargers
"Great view and lots of food and convenient options, but slooooooow. This is one of the slowest Tesla chargers I've ever seen. I'm the only person here charging and it's not over 35kw. I only needed 15 miles added to get to my destination and it's taking almost 30 mins."
"Great views, walkable to shops/restaurants. No fee for parking."
Great way to charge
Great well lit at night easy access and the machines were clean also
Great when you need a fast charge
Great while traveling on 43
"Great, convenient place to charge. Market Basket is right there if you need some groceries (or some pretty good sushi), the mall is right next door in case you want to do other shopping while you charge. There are bathrooms in both places. 110 Grill is walkable too."
"Great, convenient place. 150 khwt charging speed."
"Great, has 12 stalls with high speed supercharging. Sheraton hotel is nearby. Didn't try bathroom usage there, but expect to do well . Easy to find :-) . Big Stop & Shop supermarket nearby."
"Great, in for 20min & on ur way"
"Great, quick, and less cost effective"
Great!
"Great! I love the Meijer ones because their snack selection is so great. Fresh food is usually hard to find on the road, but if you're going to be stopped a little longer, it's great to have the option of going into a supermarket."
"Great!! Food andcother store, i visit 3 ocassion at april 2023 and is busy ussually."
Great…. But $4 just to go in the garage. Is there anyway to avoid the parking fee.
"Grid shows 8 available spots. Upon arrival at 10% with no other local options, I pull in to find non tesla vehicles parked in every bay but one. Guess what...? That had to be the one with a bent prong making it not fit into port. I went inside the hotel to express concern over the issue. The gal was not helpful at all and simply said sorry the lot is full. When I suggested that she call hotel security to come gather license plate info to cross reference with hotel guests, that's when she said ""well, I can come move my car"".  What!? She then came and moved her personal vehicle which was double parked and blocking multiple bays.
Careful guys! This is not a tesla friendly location.
FYI... I was able to macgyver the bent prong and get it back in service."
Grocery store across from parking lot
"Gross negligence by tesla to not study traffic patterns. This little town, New Paltz I guess, has GROSSLY inadequate traffic flow coming off thruway. Took 6minutes off highway and that's with a somewhat awkward uturn.. Waiting in normal flow would be two to three times longer. This is Fri afternoon in summer but take it into account. Getting back on highway should be simpler.

SC itself obviously works well, V3.

Small diner very close. Bigger shopping center a bit further.

Uncovered walk so rain or sun is problem.

Trailer pull X1."
Guests only
Guy who owns the spot was super nice. Has a couple Tesla’s himself and basically set this up to help travelers cover the stretch. Awesome!
Had a good experience charging at this location. Stalls were not super busy (used it at night). Has good places around to eat like BWW and Sonic. Also has a shopping mall around. 👍👍
"Had a small wait, very busy charger. This charger is super easy to get to when coming off of The Turnpike. Wawa inside equally as busy. Small grassy area for the pups too."
"Had been to Hard Rock casino superchargers last year when visiting the area.  But, at that time there was no automated entrance and exit gates.

It cost $15 to get access to the parking garage where the superchargers are located.  There was a line of 6 cars waiting for an open charger.  Cars kept coming in and sometimes ignored the line and snagged a charger after previous electric car backed out and was in front of the waiting line, the just arrived new car would take the charger, making the waiting time longer.  With 16 miles left, I had to continue waiting.

I was able to charge car finally, but the long wait caused the preconditioning to wear off and took longer!

Happy to be charged, but access to charger doubled cost for me.  Not likely to visit the area again."
Had fun watching the deer move about while charging up. Diner nearby seemed lively. CHP also cruised thru and I felt safe in this charging station.
Had to 2 days b4 at night. We felt safe. On our way home and we're charged again.  Bakery was open. Nice place
Had to use twice due to power being out at home due to a storm. Wasn't busy either time. Enough chargers to have a space between vehicles.
Had to wait 10 minutes for a space and 200 miles took about 40 minutes. It was the best $20 I spent in Vegas.
"Had two stalls that were full on my way to the Raleigh service center.  On my way back to Winston there was 2 stalls avaliable.  Super busy in the middle of lunch rush.  The sheetz bathrooms were disgusting also, so beware."
Half of the chargers were blocked off due to parking lot restrictions. Also made it difficult to enter/exit
Half of the charging stations are not working at this location.
"Half the chargers aren’t working right now, but fine if you find one that works! There are plenty of shopping/restaurants, but quite a walking distance."
"happy so far with this place, but the booth customer service rep is basically non existent. they are just getting paid to sit in a booth basically- otherwise, charging experience has been fine, i dont mind paying the 10$ fee but i dont understand who and how is the fee shown on my tesla screen being paid for? is that part being covered from Tesla or am i paying for that directly?"
Happy to go to Festival for shopping even though I only meant to go charge my Tesla for free. 😆
Happy to see a new supercharger on 285.  Was only car in the am and had 212mph/hr charging speed. After coming back in the pm there was another car and speeds were closer to 90/hr.
"Hard pass.
There are signs all over the chargers about only customer's of the restaurant being able to use the restrooms. Zero convenience factors and we refused to even look in the restaurant."
"Hard thing to rate but I've never had to wait, so that's something! How else are you going to get anywhere anyway"
Hard to find and need to back up into traffic through the shopping center to get to the chargers. Speed is as advertised though
Hard to find as Tesla gps dropped out at parkjng garage. Must enter parking garage at 1st level the proceed to 2nd level at the west end.
"Hard to find at 1st attempt,  but will locate easily next time."
"Hard to find at first. It’s in the main parking garage, near outback. On the 2nd floor. You have to pay for parking."
"Hard to find for first time visitors. Directions below. Not all charging stations work.
👉🏾it’s on the first level underground underneath the giant eagle grocery store. You’ll find it on the turn to continue to go further down to lower levels of parking.
Hope that helps.
👉🏾 This only allows for a certain amount of charging. You’ll have to stop and then restart or risk being there for hours to get to 180.
👉🏾 Because this lot is out of view for the most part, it has been the FILTHIEST LOT I’ve ever seen.
People are disgusting 🤮 and for the most part, it’s non-Tesla drivers tossing their trash into the charging spots.
👉🏾Plan ahead if you plan on charging here on a holiday or during holiday travel season.
Non-Tesla’s will park in the spots for us to charge the car and be there for HOURS on end."
Hard to find. Wish to have more street signs for correct directions. SuperCharger is located inside the parking structure on level 3.
Hard to spot when you miss the roundabout  and space too tiny and expensive compared to some charging stations
"Harrah’s Casino in Biloxi has no EV charging, Tesla or other, available. (Nov. 2022)"
Has 2 J1772 plugs and 2 Tesla plugs. All working as of 2-4-22.
Has 8 Tesla chargers AND 4 level 2 J1772 chargers all for free no app no card nothing needed just grab and plug in!
"Has a few chargers and convenient and next to Meijer’s. It’s very popular and every time I’ve come there’s only 1-2 chargers left and charging takes at least 20-30mins
There are 12 new superchargers that are in the works, but not ready for use."
Has a J1772(Level 2) plug. Able to charge my Leaf just fine while going to eat at a nearby restaurant
"Has a trash and recycling can, bathroom inside the subway."
"Has been coming here to charge every time we go on long road trips but this is the first time I had the pleasure of seeing all stalls occupied. I waited, maybe, 5 minutes before it was my turn. 36 minutes later I was all by myself. 🤪"
Has everything you need.  While charging!
"Has older 150kW  charging. Stalls 4A and 4B only seem to charge at half power (70-75kW). Stall 3B provided more than 130kW when not shared. At least it's $0.35/kWh, vs $0.45/kWh at other locations, so that kind of makes up for the finicky charging."
Has the amenities of a gas station and restaurants nearby. Few slots but seldom full.
Have been using this location for over a year. Charging speed is starting slow down with time. Trash cans are also never empited out and it smells of urine all around the area.
Have charged our Model 3 here several times while shopping - thanks for the electrons!
Have had a few problems with the #1 charger turning off unexpectedly. Easy to access restrooms in the hotel and food within walking distance.
Have no WC around here
Have not been there yet. But seems nice.
Have to be a guest to charge and was willing to pay for a room but all the  rooms were booked so kinda out of luck with no juice.
Have to call security to access charger before outlets opened. No bathroom early either.  And charge was limited to 56 kW despite empty lot and listed as 150.  Worst Supercharger I’ve used in years.
Have to pay $5 to the hotel to turn on the charger. And good luck if you can even get a spot with access to the charger itself (especially on a Saturday night)
"Have to pay for parking. Old and outdated chargers are very slow and inconsistent. Also no bathroom, nowhere to get food or walk the dogs."
Have to pay to park but less than $4 for an hour and you can shop at target Best Buy or uniqlo while you charge.  The supercharger look different but they are new and fast.   Located 2nd level.
Have used 4 times on round trips to Coast.  Model Y towing RV and did not have to uncouple as slots are drive in front first.  Lots of room to maneuver trailer.  Lots of street people but never had a problem with them.
Haven't been here in a while but they are all rearranged. The website and onboard navigation has these listed at 250kw now. I have a 2018 so pegged at 150 so can't tell. I did post a pic of the specs on the stalls.
Haven't had rule farms in a while and had just came intown the food was garbage for the 1st time in the morning the chicken was cold and dry such a disappointment
"Head to this set instead of the 120kW set. Easier to navigate back to at a busy time of day since Starbucks line backed up to Main Street when I arrived to the entrance tesla navigation directed me to. Larger parking lot, faster chargers, all the same conveniences as the other set"
"Heads up, this is a small site in a hotel parking lot.  So not that many chargers.  You turn at the Hilton Garden Inn entrance, not before.  Also, there is no food or easy bathroom close by.  You can use Hilton lobby bathroom, I think.  There is a Whole Foods across a busy street and a bit of a hike.  I only come here because my family lives nearby, otherwise I would choose a different location that has a convenience store."
"Healthy snacks and a bathroom can be found at the grocery outlet the chargers share a parking lot with. There’s a little, but enough, grass around the parking lot for dog potty breaks and a short walk to stretch their legs. Try to glance around the left side of grocery outlet — sometimes you can see cows grazing!"
"Heaven on earth for Tesla owners. Located in the centre of the city. One block from the lake.
There are quite no of chargers which makes it convenient to charge in reasonable time. I just wish it was by the lake so charging would have been more fun 😝"
Hello Tesla fan Tesla fam Another quick supercharger review. This one is in Turlock to California with 17 charging slots 2 currently are out of order with a maximum  charge of 250 kW.  plenty to do around here there is a Baskin Robbins staples big lots and other food choices.
"Helped me on my way to Salt Lake City. They charge $1 per one hour of charge, they take cash or card. The library has to be open so they can take payment and turn the system on. If you come after hours then it won't help. It's not the fast supercharger so you are going to spend some time here... maybe you can read a book while at it!"
"Here at 11:30am on a Tuesday. Not busy, lots of chargers, clean, appears safe, close to ABQ Uptown shopping center and fast charging. Worked great!"
"Here at the Tesla electric vehicle charger. Stands
A new apartment complex. The Name is ""Live Oak"" Apartments. Since April 20th 2021 A very nice place to live. Thank you ""LIVE OAK"" and to you too Google. It's nice to have a gigantic platform like this to share our experience with millions of people instantly. 👍👍👍👍👍"
Hhhhhhhhhhhh bbhhhhh3 iii
Hi everyone I stop at the surperchargers in gilman . And as a black man I was cool . But I could tell I wasn’t wanted . People watching every move I made it was really sad to see Happening but what ever .
Hidden behind a hotel sort of near a Chinese restaurant. No real food options to speak of. Wouldn’t recommend planning your trip around it. However ! Find the Vietnamese cafe 8 minutes away it is awesome
"Hidden behind the Speedway gas station. Really tricky to find the first time.
Stopped by here on the way to Truckee since it is the last supercharger on the way up.
Giving it 4 stars since there is nothing here to check out while charging (though there’s Ikedas across the freeway)."
"High charging speeds. Pretty clean bathroom. Gas station, truck stop restaurant. Subway and McGross across busy road.
Only Telsa there. A VW did come back in, attempted to charge then left???"
"High speed charger but also high prices.... $0.41/kWh as of 4-28-2022 They also have a dedicated tesla entrance with a cool red neon sign! To go in, press the button and say ""Im charging my Tesla may I use the restroom please?"" Youll hear the door unlock and the restrooms are past the double doors across the lobby to the right"
"High speed, no waiting. Plus there's a restroom in Meijer and you can pick up snacks, drinks, or anything really."
"High usage supercharger, as usual works great, busy, bathrooms available and still price to charge is slightly high compared to other alternatives."
High-speed charger with an amazing location next to Tommyknocker Brewery. One thing to note is that mobile data speeds are slow at this location.
High-speed little to no wait and lots o stalls
Higher charging speeds than the Centennial supercharger.
"Highly recommend stopping at these superchargers off of 4th St in El Centro as opposed to the ones by the mall off of Dogwood. These are 250s versus the 120s by the mall. Closer to the freeway. And this sushi place has clean restrooms, free Wi-Fi, friendly staff, and most importantly Cheeto crusted sushi burritos. Tesla nav automatically routed me to the v2 chargers by the mall, so you might need to manually route to this one."
Hilton staff were super kind and pointed us to a restroom + coffee!
"Hip, hip, hooray for another Holiday Inn Tesla Supercharger Site. We were able to charge without dropping our trailer but there was room to drop if necessary."
His charger was fine. I have a hard time giving the charger five stars unless it's covered or it does something else that makes it stand out. There are a decent number of chargers here but that's about the only thing special about it.
"Hit this charger 2 times on an out and back trip.  Both times I topped out at 60 Kw, which is grossly inadequate.  Bathroom access at the hotel earns an overall 2 star."
Hmmm
"Holiday Inn Express parking lot. Google Street View does not show the chargers in the parking lot at this time, but they are there.

Coming from I-64 on Seneca Trail past Walmart, turn left on Piercy Dr (in between Arby's & City National Bank).

Turn right on Hunter (just after City National Bank) and you'll see the Holiday Inn Express.

8 chargers. Lots of nearby food options to drive to after/ before charging.

There was nobody at the front desk of the hotel to ask to use the the restroom so I walked past the front desk (on the right) to the bathrooms that are halfway down the hallway."
Holiday station store in the parking lot.
"Holy cow! So fast! We love this super charger! Easy access to 24-hour Schnucks grocery store, too."
"Honestly I have to go to this location all the time.  I just wish there was an easier access to Bathrooms, other than having to go to a hotel to use the public restroom.  Its nice that it is right off 90, but you have to make a trek to go to the gas station or Kiney drugs while charging.  Good news you can get your steps in!  :)"
"Honestly not sure what not to dislike about the charging station. Lol
This location is behind a Holiday Inn with 8 charging stations and is very spacious. There isn't much of anything besides the Holiday Inn. It was conveniently located for us and the charging was pretty quick. I had to use the bathroom and the Holiday inn folks nice to let me use their bathroom. There are lights in the parking lot so that was nice not to sit at the door.  Every charging station seems to be in good condition."
Honestly Tesla super chargers in this place decent and having some time to window shopping or food time. But if more than 10 plus cars are in charging spot it will be waiting to get charged.
Horrible non Teslas take up the parking spots bc Wawa lets them do 15 min parking I waited 10 mins just to get an open spot and I’m literally the only Tesla here right now. I wish I can give them 0 stars
"Horrible supercharger. Always full and even at 20% SOC, I get 47 kW and 1 hr to 80% charge. The only good thing is the Starbucks nearby. If you need amenities, I suggest you get your coffee and bathroom break here and then proceed to the Gen 3 supercharger in Buttonwillow 11 miles down the I5 (24551 West Lerdo Highway). It is not on Google maps yet but it is on Tesla’s map. There are no amenities at the Gen 3 charger (seems like they are building a center but it is not completed) but you get charged in half the time."
Horrible.  Arrived with 50 miles and no stalls working.  Advised by Tesla to use a local L1 charger to get enough charge to make next supercharger.  Had 3 other cars experience the same issue (not charging) so looks to be a site issue.
Horribly slow every time. Says 150kw but I've never got above 80kw. Others say they are getting about the same. They do have some new chargers but I was only getting 63kw on them.
Hotel allows non-guests to use charger for flat fee of $10.83. Very nice and accommodating.
"Hotel Indigo has two charging stations. Each has a Tesla connector and a regular one. They are intended for Hotel guests, but the Hotel is sometimes lenient about that."
Hotel is closed. Charger unavailable
"Hotel Marshfield is a recently remodeled hotel.  The public spaces have a modern design, and include lobby, bar and restaurant.  My family has used the Tesla charger several times for our car."
"Hotel provides bathrooms, but not much else in walking distance.

Picture is my 2013 p85 next to a brand new plaid."
Hotel staff very friendly and destination chargers work well. There's 3 chargers.
Hotel staff was extremely nice and meets approaching attitude. We did witness someone being a little rude to a Tesla owner who walked in with a very entitled attitude! Ask nicely and maybe start with a little conversation and they will likely be nice in return!
How can you rate one anything but 5 stars
"How fun it looks to sit and wait for your car to charge , so you can go another 10 miles ! Lol
Idiotic if you asked me ....and it did ....so I'm sharing !
Its senseless to waste the huge amount of natural resources to create and continue to power a battery that will cause Huge problems when it comes time to replace and dispose of , not to mention the fossil fuels it takes to create and charge !"
How much do you want for it?
How recent was this opened?
How stupid!  Just no.
Huge
"Hurricane Ian did nock out some stations but this one is working!

If you need to charge come here"
Hy-Vee is only open limited hours. Try the Kwik trip in town for coffee.
"Hy-Vee parking lot. Fast chargers. Bathrooms plentiful. They are to the left when you walk in, after the registers."
"I agree w/ all the other positive reviews. However if I wanted to be super picky & sound spoiled.... some sun shades over the parking spaces similar to those free vacuum areas at car washes would be awesome & also afew times now the folks that use the back pumps  & leave their vehicles running while they fill their tank they also leave their headlights on which happen to shine directly at the ones charging.

- Just a girl in a Uber Tesla rental"
I Always get good speeds at this charger (100kW+)
"I am going to have to agree with other reviewers.  It definitely looks like there is zero upkeep at this location trash all over the place every charger both times I have stopped by were full had to wait.

It looks like people come charge for like 10 min and leave.

It’s located by a Target and several other food places so you can eat or shop while you charge.  Be mindful late at night."
"I am realizing that superchargers at malls are not always the greatest. Malls are not open 24/7. Neither are restaurants. Today is Christmas Day. Thank goodness there is a Hyatt with a restaurant because none of the other restaurants are open. And I know that it is a holiday and many things are closed, but it means malls are not the greatest places to put chargers."
"I am sitting here now and it works. I was definitely a little worried because previous reviews suggest otherwise. There's not Wawa or Sheetz. But there's a casino!

Also the photo I posted shows 60kW, but it was just warming up. It's up to 141kW now."
"I am visiting Pueblo and this is a great location to charge up before heading out to pikes peak, Garden of the Gods, or even Cave of the Wind. Pikes Peak is really steep and from the pay gate to the top you will use approx 60 miles of charge. You will gain a good 5-10 back on your way down so charge up!

As of 20 Oct 2022 this garage is free."
I appreciate being able to charge on my road trip but this 150kw station is slow please upgrade to version 3 chargers. Nothing walkable except the casino 🫤
"I appreciate Tesla adding superchargers in many places but this is a complete fail. Not only is the area sketchy and the spots are tight,  there are CONSTANTLY trucks and non Tesla vehicles parked in spots for hours on end. They even park in front of your car while it's charging and then you can't get out! They use it as a free parking spot as there are no repercussions."
I appreciate that they added a portapotty for when the Sage center is closed. No food but otherwise a nice spot to stop. Someone put real effort into plowing their giant parking lot.

"I appreciate the new location, close by the Cleveland Clinic campus, university circle, and downtown. But there is NOTHING to visit nearby except a CVS across the street. In the actual shopping center there are a bunch of vacant buildings, a dollar mart, a family dollar, BMV, and a bunch of random businesses like hair salons and a vet. Went to the Family Dollar and it looked like a tornado had gone through the place, but that seemed normal to the employees.

A good supercharger to stay in your car."
I believe in going green as being a very important thing for the Earth and during this travel from Texas to Illinois and how much gas I've put in and how many miles I guess got me or not comparatively because if it's $25 for 300 miles in Tesla vehicle I think I probably would have made it further with one of them! but I only know how to work on regular mechanics ever so slightly.. so probably why even if I had a bunch of money it would be important for me to have one of each? Lolol
I believe it’s the best place ! And they should open more Tesla supercharger station in Puerto Rico
I came here desperately to charge my Tesla while on my road trip from Omak. I couldn’t make it to Entiat and was down to 5%. Me and my daughter were really hungry so we went next door. This extremely rude women named Alisha turned the Tesla charger off. I realized an hour later. Still desperate she rudely said it’s for customers only. I asked why she didn’t have a sign up. She said oh yeah I’ll take that into consideration. She said if i come over she will turn it back on. She gave us tons of attitude and repeatedly told us we had to order. I wouldn’t give them your business. Siren song wines next store has positive energy. Amazing wine. Beautiful gorgeous views and a full menu. They apologized to me on behalf of fielding a winery. I wish i could have stayed and gave them more of my business.
"I can confirm: it charged the car. But did it charge my soul? Unfortunately, this is where the rating tumbles downhill like a train loaded with too much plutonium. The land around this place is an asphalt underworld, a soulless suburban big-box dystopia. You can get Buffalo Wild Wings and your hair waxed, yet this place is hungry for a soul, and it is best that you sit in your car doomscrolling lest it gnaw a chunk off of yours.
The ion beam will be visiting soon."
I charge here daily in the mid afternoon.  Always get 200kwh + when charging below 20% and get up to 85% in less than 30 minutes in my Model 3 Performance.  I've never had to wait to plug in.
"I charge here frequently there is always chargers available, I’ve never gone here and not been able to charge. I usually go around 3:30 - 4:30 after I leave work always great conversations around the color of my car as well lol. Tesla Owners are very friendly we talk to everyone, say hello I’ll speak, 1 of these things do not match the others lol."
"I charge here frequently, always a pleasant experience. There's a steak 'n shake and a few other restaurants nearby. The parking lot is in need of a little bit of work but aside from that it works perfect!"
I charged my i3 here with my jdapter stub and had good results
"I charged recently and faced same charging issue as discussed before. The levels are around 35kW at this station, specifically on port 3C. Please fix ASAP or at least add a way to report it Tesla."
I circled the parking lot three times and found no trace of a charging station. Please remove.
"I come here 2 times a week to charge my car. Usually no wait, but a line can happen at busier times."
"I come here frequently on the way home from work. Never too busy. Multiple places to eat close by. My favorite is Tasu, but there is also a Freddy’s and PDQ. Safe, clean location."
I come to San Carlos quite often and I did not know that this supercharger was here because usually when I come my car is fully charged. It’s a very convenient location right off the freeway. Also there is a Starbucks Petsmart Best Buy home goods TJ Maxx and other food restaurants within walking distance. San Carlos is pretty safe so I wouldn’t worry about being here at night but I probably wouldn’t want to be here alone at night either even if it is safe just because everything would be closed.  Sometimes there’s a lot of high traffic to get into the parking lot because there’s so many businesses that surround it but once you’re in there’s plenty of superchargers and plenty of parking. I definitely will come back again. #soknotyoung
"I constantly only get around 35kW at this station, specifically on port 3C. No idea what the deal is here. I think it might be an error. Please fix ASAP or at least add a way to report it Tesla."
"I couldn’t be more happy with this charging stop.   There was a nice sitting area, trash cans, and a small dog park.  The Whichwhich sandwich shop is always a favorite and the small convenience store was very clean and the staff was super friendly."
I did not find any chargers or it is not properly located in the maps
I did not like that it did not tell you a landmark or gas station it is at!
"I did not like this place at all. For starters this is a V2 supercharger. Was there at night. It's crazy but there are no lights at this location. Very dark. Nothing nearby. No restrooms when Tesla store closed.

Tesla, How in the world is there no V3 supercharges in Northern NJ and the Hudson Valley NY??? If you are going from NYC to Middletown NY for example. Or further up Rt 17 in NY? Only V2. Very far spread out too. You need more in this area.

I do see V3 coming to 17 NJ in Mahwah Q3 2023 according to your maps. Please expedite this location!!  This would help!"
"I did not use the Tesla destination charger, but I did park my car in this lot. They are very unprofessional and irresponsible! On October 10th, 2022 I left my car at 12:50AM to October 11th when I came to pick up my car. My apple watch had been stolen along with my phone charger! I filed a compliant and no response till this day!"
I didn't use the charge station. But from my observation I can see that it would benefit to add at lease 10 more units.  It gets very facts and people are waiting at times to be able to charge there vehicles.
I didn’t use the chargers but went close enough for a visual inspection.  Imagine the convenience and thoughtfulness in building this charging station for your comfort.  Many charging stations and I only saw one vehicle using it at the time I was there.  Looks professional and high end elements were used in constructing it.
"I didn’t used, but is good they have that service for the people"
I do not recommend coming here! Staff is so rude!
"I don't feel super safe at this location. I would only charge here during the day time with lots of traffic. Right next to Townplace Suites, where you can use the clean restroom. Only restaurant in walking distance is Applebee's.👎"
I don't have a Tesla but it is amazing they have these available locally. I love seeing when Tesla owners stop in and charge! It is always fun getting to see the cars
I don't have A Tesla. The charging stations looks fancy though...
"I don't have an electric car but if I did there are multiple places to charge your vehicle.
The strategy of locations makes it convenient to charge while you shop"
"I don't have an electric car to charge , but the Baskin Robbins ice cream is awesome"
I don't have Tesla but they charge there when they have one
I don't know to be honest. I pulled over into Sheetz to sleep. It was so nice snd quiet. Five stars. Great place to nap.
"I don't know, I drive a gas vehicle and couldn't get the charger to connect to my gas tank for some reason. Do not recommend"
"I don't like paying to park but I understand. However, if I am paying extra I should get something for it, the space is very tight and people walk through the lot like it is a sidewalk. I have even seen skateboarders practice inside the charging area and I am willing to bet it is only a matter of time before one of them loses control and damages a car.  I prefer to avoid this place when possible."
"I don't own a Tesla and everytime I pass by here, all the charging station are full. Not a good thing to see if you own a Tesla in my opinion."
"I don't own a tesla myself, but I am beyond happy to have this in the neighborhood."
"I don't own a Tesla or an electric car, but if I did I would use these chargers. Very convenient if you're staying at the inn! Hi Charley"
"I don't own a Tesla or need a super charger but they seem and look excellent! Every time I see them, I can't help but look. Nice and I see people using them. If I ever buy a Tesla and use the Supercharger, I will update my review. I'm basing this on what I have observed with other customers. They seem happy with it."
"I don't own a tesla so I came here to charge my phone because it was only at 99%  and I was afraid of losing contact with my dear friends but when I arrived they pushed me away telling me that I couldn't charge it there #Justice for my phone it is now at 98%, and my family thinks I'm dead."
I don't own one but looks good to me clean good shape good location
I don't think these are Superchargers but they were fast enough. I think it took us an hour to charge around 30 percent. And parking was very good and not too expensive. Although you do pay extra for parking but it's not massive. I think was about 5 dollars an hour.
"I don’t use the tesla chargers, I use the other ones. The non tesla chargers are great to have but I’ve found they are very slow! So just be warned that this is not a place you will get much of a charge from."
"I dont have a tesla but uh, where is the charging station?"
"I dont know why it says 250kw, everytime i use this i can only get 70kw, even preheated battery.  But when i go to west hartford station i get better charge."
I dont own a Tesla but the Tesla owners in the parking lot looked like they were having alot of fun.
I enjoyed the nearby shopping center so we could let the car charge and stretch our legs. Too many stores to visit. Would also be nice to charge and shop at Sams Club.
"I evaluate supercharged not only on the charging, but availability of bathroom and snacks near by.  This location is perfect as it   is located next to dunkin donuts just before the sygamore bridge. All we need in one location."
I felt like I stepped into a frickin sci-fi movie that's all I'm saying on this topic
I felt like I stepped into a frickin sci-fi movie that's all I'm saying on this topic
I find myself coming here to park and charge my Tesla on the top floor often. I love that I can plug in and go grab some lunch near by or go check out a few stores or just sit in my car and relax. Very centralized to downtown   and is kept clean. Great place for a charge!!!
"I found a Tesla Supercharger in Page, AZ, which was a nice surprise. It's located in the Marriott Courtyard parking lot. There's not much to do nearby, but the charging speed is about 500 miles per hour, so the wait is short. The views are good too. A useful stop for Tesla drivers in the area."
I found all chargers available and enough places to visit while you charge
I found that this location was never too busy compared to the other superchargers in the areas between Houston and New Orleans. It is also close to a few restaurants of walking distance. Charging was always a breeze!
I get a real charge at these places.
"I give 3 stars because even though we were the only car the highest I saw was 70kw going into the battery.

It is in the shade when it's hot, plus near taco bell, and a grocery store."
"I give this higher stars But I tried to pump my gas here.
And nothing Kinda disappointing"
I got 146 kw.  It in Wawa parking lot.  Car wash behind Wawa $2 for self wash
I got coffee at the casino while waiting for my Model S to charge up. Charging speed 350+ miles per hour
"I got here around 1230am and EVERYTHING was closed. Just a heads up for those of us who are always looking for a bathroom. You might not find one here depending on the time of day. Otherwise, no complaints. Got a good charge and then drove somewhere else for the bathroom."
"I got up to 560 miles/hour (fast!) at about 133 kW. (Rated up to 150 kW.) 10 Tesla Supercharger stalls in a large JCPenny parking lot in Mehlville, MO."
I had a bad charging experience here.  My model y was around 10% and it wouldn’t charge faster than 300mph which is pretty slow for a supercharger.
I had an excellent experience charging at the Tesla Super charger. It is a safe secure area surrounded by plenty of restaurants. A PDQ and a chinese restaurant were a few feet away. A Home 2 suites by Hilton was also a stones throw away. It took about 45 min to fully charge the Tesla. There were 12 brand new charging stations.  The area is clean and free of debris. There was only one other Tesla there charging at the time and they were finished moments after I began charging. We exchanged a friendly wave. Tesla love.😊 I will be back to explore the area shopping and food. Total came up to a little over $11 dollars. Glad the charging station.
"I had no option but to go to this station, at 8 pm on a Friday. My navigator showed 1 station was available. I arrived there with a 6 car waiting line. After 40 min I finally get to the charger. The car on the charger next to me was just parked not even charging. There is still a line of 5 cars waiting. Parking on chargers should be fined specially at this location where chargers are limited and it is the only one for the area, the next closest one is 10 miles away.

This supercharging station works great. However, it is the only one that serves the North Houston area  on I45 (the woodlands, spring,Conroe) and is not enough. Lately, I have found it is pretty packed and have to wait for 3 or 4 vehicles ahead of me.  Each vehicle takes at the very least 20 min, that is a minimum of 1 hr to be able to use it.  Also don’t understand why other non-EV vehicles are allowed to circulate in and out through the stations. They use it as a short cut to the gas station next to it, making traffic and overall circulation more difficult."
"I had to back up twice as the charging chord isn’t as long as I expected it to be, but could strike that up to being a first time user."
I hate the 80% max charge setting. What a waste of my time
"I hate the pull in chargers. Tights spots in a ""less than desirable"" part of town."
"I hate to do one star, they are very pretty chargers. However, you have to pay the $50 valet fee to charge. Not bad if you're there anyway. Very excessive if you just want to charge."
"I have been coming to this mall since I was a kid. Very happy to see they have added a super charger. Usually not too many people charging here, great place to stop, eat, and shop."
"I have been here 3 times out of which 2 were after sunset. There were always homeless people hanging around the super charger area. Also both times there were cop cars patrolling the area.
This is one of the great superchargers in terms of the charging speed, unfortunately not at a great location. I would rather go to the Auburn mall for charging than here."
"I have liked ALL the Superchargers I've used. I have a suggestion to make. It would be very helpful to include the name of the business where the Supercharger is located. In some locations it is difficult to actually find the chargers from the location on the map. You can get close, but several times, I've had to ask at several businesses before actually finding the chargers."
"I have never charged at over 120KW, regardless of day of week between 4pm and 7pm."
"I have never seen this Supercharger completely full. It is busy, but there’s always at least a few stalls open. It’s actually covered on the ground level of the Whole Foods garage which provides shade and protection from the elements especially on super hot or super cold days. There’s a Starbucks nearby as well which I can easily get to and back in about 10 minutes."
I have not been here before but it had a 1 star so I gave it 5
"I have noticed last few times charging very very slow, I see "
"I have stopped at the supercharger four or five times. I have never once had to wait for a charger. They are conveniently located just off of the I-10 exit. As of December 2022, these are 250KW chargers. So they charge fairly quickly.

It is conveniently located behind a BBQ joint. The restaurant serves good food and drink, but above all has clean restrooms.

The Supercharger is also near a Dairy Queen for those who want a little treat."
I have to pay parking to pay charging now? Don’t make sense having ev car
I have used this charger 2 times now. Both times only got 56kw. Came in with 20% and preconditioned. Not sure what the deal is. There was not a car next to me and it was about half full. I would suggest stopping at Centerville or Madisonville 250kw. Both of those actually give full values.
I have used this location several times and never seems to be a wait. Plus you can hit up HEB if needed!
"I have visited the Tesla supercharger add this location multiple times. If I arrive and all 12 stalls are taken It normally only takes 5 minutes for a stall to be available!  Thanks Elon Musk!  Oh, and by the way, thank you for buying Twitter! I signed up for my account the other day! It’s amazing how many close minded people are on there though. They call themselves ex Twitter employees.  Lol. Go Figure!"
I have zero cost supercharging. Nice to have several sites in the valley to use.
"I judge superchargers based on charging, availability of bathrooms and food.
This supercharger is new, has v3 charging.
Bathrooms are  near by in stop and shop supermarket. Bathrooms are to the right when you enter the store."
"I judge superchargers based on charging, availability of bathrooms and food.
This supercharger is new, has v3 charging.
Bathrooms are close in hannaford supermarket. Bathrooms are right near the door.  However, when when I was there the floor was sticky with pee, no toilet paper, and one of the two faucets didn't work. Soap was in small bottles laying on the counter. Hopefully, this unpleasant situation is temporary.
There are no places to eat, but supermarket , of course, has snacks to buy."
"I judge superchargers based on charging, availability of bathrooms and food.
This supercharger is new, has v3 charging.
Bathrooms are near by inside neon market.  Bathrooms are on the right as you enter. Clean. The market has food and drink."
"I judge superchargers not only based on charges but availability of bathrooms and snacks.  The big issue here are bathrooms.  There two bathrooms market basket, but MB closed at nine. In addition to get there from the Tesla charger you have to walk over a hilly grass area, and it will be impassible with the snow on the ground. Other stores will not be any better as all stores close at the same time."
"I know 150kw are not state of art.. but getting there with 5% and only charting at 50kw is too slow.. barely a supercharger. Location around was good though, ate sushi! :)"
I know nothing of this spot. I only rode by on my bicycle
I know where it is
"I like how people that rated this Tesla Supercharger 1 star are either trolling or don't understand it's not for every electric vehicle.

Onto the actual review: It's a great spot with lots of shopping and restaurants to eat at. There's a movie theater across the street and lots of other amenities around. The parking lot was clean, lines were nice and visible, which made parking a breeze. The shopping center security goes around at night and makes sure there's nothing that shouldn't be there. Overall a great spot to charge your Tesla."
I like it. It's next to the mall so you can Walk around or shop as you charge. I noticed it gets really busy on weekends so plan accordingly.
"I like that the supercharger is way in the back so that other patrons won't have to stare at you and you won't be in the way of other parking spaces. This supercharger is at a Sheetz, so you'll be able to use the bathroom, get food, drink and walk around a bit. Four stars because it isn't covered, like most superchargers on the East Coast."
I like the location but im only getting 35kW.  Ive tried 3 stations and they are all the same.
"I like this location because it’s near an area where you can take a break and stretch your legs, use the restroom, or grab a quick bite. There are only a few chargers there but it’s a good spot nonetheless."
I like this super charger stop. There is an arby's and it is a good night stop eith some darker stalls where you can take a quick nap if need be. The area is clean and and my charging seemed to be quicker than most of my average charging stops.
I like using this supercharger. It's never busy and it will let me charge you up to 90%. Super convenient. Very clean all the stations work and not too far off the freeway.
"I live in a nearby apartment building and use this Supercharger frequently.  It's busy, but usually great, and I rarely have to wait.  But, last month, one of the 8 chargers was out if order & it took quite a while for it to be repaired (at least 2 weeks, I think....I wasn't monitoring it!).  I went there today, had to wait 30 minutes because 3 of the chargers weren't working!   This is very disappointing."
I love being able to pull straight in without having to do the obnoxious back in move. We spent a few minutes picking up some treats in the Food Lion after using the restrooms and got back on the road.
"I love charging my Tesla at this location! The price stays the same, and it's easy to access
Other thing I noticed , people leave their trash behind!"
"I love eating here! My friends and family all say that when it’s open, that’s where we all want to go eat! Customer service is amazing, the food is usually great, low prices, and if I could give it 6 stars I would easily!"
I love parking on this side of the Sheetz were I get to see Tesla drivers recharge their Tesla's just pass the airport . in knowing that one day I will join them at a supercharger .
I love supercharger locations where if you want a longer charge there is stuff to do.  This is one of the nicer locations I've been to.
"I love superchargers in close proximity to grocery stores like Meijer. Helps that you can use the facilities, purchase healthy food, fresh fruits and drinks at grocery store prices while you are picking up some essential electrons for onward travel."
i love tesla super chargers.  This one was ~ 65 W.  Hopefully it gets upgraded to higher wattage soon.  250 w.
I love that there is almost never a wait to charge your car. I HATE the location of the chargers. It's on a busy entrance and far far away from the mall you have to walk like a mile just to get to the mall when their are cars speeding last the station every 30 seconds it gives me anxiety to take my kids out the car to walk a mile to the mall. I wish they planned this better. I know this is a failing mall so it's too late to change anything but I definitely consider going to different stations instead of this one because of the poor logistics on their part.
I love the amount of chargers that are at this location and the ease of getting in and out. And I love the outdoor factory mall to walk through while you’re waiting.  By far my favorite supercharger location that I’ve been to.
I LOVE THE TESLA EXPERIENCE!!! ❤️‍🔥🤩🥰
I love these superchargers!!! Super convenient to the mall never crowded. Excellent place to charge!!
I love this charging station. There is typically a good number of open spots and it is conveniently located near many different locations with amenities. Once in a while you will get someone that does not drive a Tesla that will park in one of the charging stations but not often.
"I love this location, super convenient right off the highway. Spacious and well lit parking lot with plenty of space to stretch your legs. Love that it's in a convenient store parking lot with clean restrooms and restaurant. Plus it's not always full so your car charges superfast at 250kwh."
I love this place which is only 5 mins from my house while there’s big power outages after the storm hit. Tesla navigation didn’t yet update this supercharger but i always come here to charge for emergency.
"I love this station: Fast charging, close to I-75, Winn-Dixie has restrooms and self-serve hot food bar. Delicious fried chicken breast (8/3 at 10:30 am)."
I love this Supercharger in the back parking lot of my favorite Target store in the country!
"I love this Tesla Super charging station. It is 150Kwh, there's a pride gas station here. So, when here, you can use the restrooms,  get some snacks or actually eat something inside. Highly recommend it if you need to charge and a near by."
"I love where this is located. Stopped in for a quick model S charge, and got a recharge myself across the street."
"I loved this Charging Station, super fast and near the I-95! For sure I’m using it again"
"I must confess to being a major fan of Buc'ees. That did, this is the best Supercharger anywhere, in my opinion. Buc'ees is a logical pick. Their restroom facilities are the cleanest in the industry & never closed or out of order. They always have an ample selection of food & drinks. If you need to buy a gift for someone on the way, they are the logical choice. I hope Tesla adds Superchargers at EVERY Buc'ees in the near future."
"I noticed a lot of ppl saying the parking lot is dirty🤷🏿‍♀️ I've witnessed a few Tesla driver throwing trash out their cars 🤷🏿‍♀️ I charge here all the time, by myself. It's like every other neighborhood throughout the Bay Area. Definitely better than charging in SF🥴 Keep your trash in the car until u find a garbage can! Best charging station so far for me👍🏿"
"I noticed this Tesla Supercharger is cheaper compared to Centralia and Tumwater Superchargers. I'm testing out to charge fully here and still be able to make it to Seattle without the need to stop at Centralia or Tumwater superchargers. Mainly driven by the lower rates. I could be wrong but it's worth a try.

As of 10/16/2022

Kelso - $0.30
Centralia - $0.43
Tumwater - $0.44"
"I only got 70KW max (only one other car), and charger 2C has a bent pin so can’t be plugged in."
"I only got just over 170 kw, but at least I got over 150."
"I only parked here in the Tesla charging lot, because it is another option to the overcrowded Mashpee, MA CVS parking lot."
"I rate chargers not on just there ability to charge, but availability of bathrooms and snacks.  This charging station is perfect.  The chargers are near a gaps station and Steward shop offers a nice bathroom and a good selection of snacks and drinks. This a v2 Tesla charger."
"I rate this charging location 3 stars overall, 5 stars on normal days, but only 1 star on busy days. The Hy-Vee parking lot is too small and these chargers are too close to the store. The result is that on busy days, most of the 8 Tesla chargers are occupied by gas cars. The attached photo is from Christmas-eve 2021, and New Years-eve (a week later) was just as bad. And of course the Tesla App/Nav cannot tell you how many spots are being blocked. Hopefully people just don't realize they are blocking the only 8 Tesla fueling spots within 80 miles. Perhaps some signage needs to make that more clear? I didn't have to wait for a spot to open up, but I'm sure some travelers did on those two days."
"I rate this place a 4 because it’s confusing and annoying. The chargers are on the first floor of the parking lot. If you want to use the bathroom you have to go to the airport. It’s a bit of a walk compare to some places.
The bathroom are clean and are located on the first floor. When you leave you have to make sure you take your ticket to the person on the booth. So she can let you pass and you don’t pay for parking. But I much rather charge at other charger."
"I rate this supercharger a four only due to lack of amenities nearby. The only recommendation is to stop at the gas station down the street south about a half mile (.3km) to get some really good fresh fried chicken at Chester’s Chicken inside the gas station. It may sound a little less than appetizing but trust me, the 3 piece meal w your choice of light or dark is the ticket. Perhaps order before charging and eat while waiting. Bring a wet cloth for driving after this must-try destination on your journey."
I really liked this stop. It’s closer in to the main drag in town instead of right next to the highway so there are quite a few walkable food options. We walked to hygge hearth coffee and got some snacks and drinks and it was pretty good.
I really was impressed with the ease of the process from A to Z and It didn't  cost much to charge the battery to 95%
"I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Tesla Supercharging station at Hotel Mission Del Oro, and it was nothing short of a delightful experience. The station's location is just perfect, as it's conveniently situated near the freeway, ensuring a quick and hassle-free pit stop for travelers.

Hotel Mission Del Oro itself is an exquisite property, offering top-notch amenities for those looking to unwind while their vehicle gets charged. The hotel's welcoming ambiance and well-appointed rooms provide a comfortable stay for guests. And if you're an AT&T user, you'll be pleased to know that the cell phone service is excellent in this area, making it easy to stay connected with friends, family, or work.

One of the highlights of this Supercharging station is its proximity to popular walkable dining options. My personal favorite has to be In-N-Out, which is just a short walk away. This iconic fast-food chain never disappoints with its mouthwatering burgers and shakes, making it an ideal choice to grab a quick bite while your Tesla charges. There are several other eateries in the vicinity, catering to a variety of tastes and preferences.

Adding to the convenience, the charging station is equipped with multiple Superchargers, ensuring availability and minimal wait times. The charging process itself is swift, allowing you to get back on the road in no time.

In conclusion, the Tesla Supercharging station at Hotel Mission Del Oro is an excellent pitstop for Tesla owners. Its strategic location, coupled with the hotel's amenities, superb AT&T cell phone service, and various dining options nearby, make it a must-visit for anyone traveling through the area."
I routed here and arrived with only 17 miles left on battery.. every single charger bagged out of order. Had to drive 18 mins north to a neighboring supercharger with only 6 miles left upon arriving there. What if there wasn't a neighboring supercharger??? NOT GOOD.. the even worse thing is that I routed that from the car!!! Nothing said out of order. NOT GOOD!! At least have an X thru the charge spot so we know it doesn't work! GET IT FIXED!!!
"I saw a guy get out of his tesla and zip up his pants, there was no one else in the car. Does the tesla have a feature I don't know about or was he just sad?"
I saw the chargers a long time before I figured out how to get there without driving over a curb. Grateful to be here arriving at 2% charge. Ted's Cafe Escondido is great.
I searched for a supercharger from Houston to Austin. This is the only one I found on route. I heard they will build one at Bukees soon. Using it was no problem but it only has like 6 stalls and is hidden in a tight spot behind a hotel. Better than no charging on my trips from Austin to Houston. I like to feel I can get home without hitting yellow on the battery. I reached home with way over 100 miles so was a good thing. My new charging station on trips to Houston from Austin. I wrote this so others could find this Columbus supercharger.
I see way more cars pulling up to get a charge than there are charging stations... The cars that are charging seem to be there quite a while!!! Sad to try and implement electric cars when there aren't enough resources for them.
I showed up to charge at 9:22 AM on a Saturday. Every spot was taken so I pulled over and waited for about two minutes. At that point; one of the Tesla’s finished and pulled out and voila I’m in! Let’s try to keep the parking spots clean of any rubbish!! There is a nice sized garbage can located between the chargers!
I spoke with the manager responsible for getting the Superchargers put in. She really believes in making the world a cleaner and better place. The location is great as it's right at a Dennys.
"I spotted a few Tesla chargers and 1 universal charger that fit my 2022 Leaf. You have to pull in the ""valet only"" entrance to access them, but I was not hassled at all and charged all night. Checked out in the morning with a full charge courtesy of the resort."
"I stayed at this motel, and was able to fully charge up my Y both nights I was there.  Had zero issues."
I stop here to fill my road rocket with lightning bolts ⚡️
I stopped at the Kum & Go both ways both ways on a trip to Des Moines. Both times there were plenty of open spaces and no problems with charging. Counter employees in the store were exceedingly nice. Very positive experience all the way around.
"I stopped here on my way to Ocean Shores and unfortunately went at peak pricing hours, but what can ya do? Haha

The reason for the 3 star is all the broken glass in the parking lot and people walking around who appeared to be high on drugs. It didn't feel like a super safe area and definitely would not want to be here after dark for a needed charge."
I stopped here on my way to Toronto from NYC. It's right by the highway. The place is very easy to get on and off. There is a little restaurant and gas station across the street but by the time I got there (after midnight) they were both closed for the nite. Anyways the chargers all work really well - they don't seem to have been abused or anything.
"I technically did not use the Tesla supercharger. However, I did use the electric vehicle charger right next to the Tesla one. It was extremely convenient and helpful, I was able to fully charge my EV for free while I shopped in the area nearby. I highly recommend if you have an EV to stop by this area, you might as well charge if you have the ability to!"
"I think I've used this supercharger four times now and the directions the onboard navigation gave me have never been correct.  You can see the charging stations to your left from Leland Ave, but you cannot take a left turn into the shopping center from that street as the navigation instructs; you have to continue past the shopping center to Auert/Herkimer and take a left at the light to get to the main entrance.  However, I've never approached this charger from the Thruway, so those directions might be better.

The station itself is well lit but it's around the corner of the building so you car will not be visible from any of the businesses in the plaza.  I also find it a little pricey, but probably just compared to charging at home.

The plaza has a Price Chopper supermarket that's open until 11PM so I assume there are no restrooms or other amenities late at night.  There are, however several convenience stores within walking distance which may be open all hours.

On the topic of amenities: if you're charging or just stopping for a while, be sure to eat at the North End Pizza and Tap a few doors down from the Price Chopper.  Their pizza and Utica Greens are great."
I think Tesla supercharger are a waste of time. If you want a real car or truck electric is not a good choice.
I think this is the best supercharger in portland .
I thought the space for pulling into the chargers was a little tight and the space was also used for parking. There were places you could drop a trailer if you were towing and needed to charge.
"I thought this place has a supercharger but it does not. There is a park that you can enjoy while your car charges. If you're looking for a quick charge, this isn't the place."
"I thought this was a great place to charge. I think there should be more like these by I-95. It saved us. We were very worried that our Model Y had only 50miles left. Anyway, great place. Many stations. A mall to go to while you wait. Can’t ask for more."
"I took those pictures on Mar 11, 2019 and posted on the Google Map, but for some reason, I can't find them, so I post them again.

We installed the 50Amp charge port at home so seldom come here to charge.  We only charged the loaner Model X twice or three times here.  This location is very close to our subdivision.  I just hope there are more supercharger around Houston area."
"I tried to charge at these destination chargers in August 2022, but the parking spaces were full of Westin hotel staff ICE vehicles.  There are no signs indicating EV only parking/charging.  The Jekyll Island Ocean Club staff tried to help but nothing happened.  Someone needs to put up some signs.  However, just south of the Ocean Club hotel is a public access parking lot for the beach that has four Tesla charger and I believe two Charge Point chargers.  There are signs and no ICE cars were blocking the charges.  The hotel staff didn't even know about the chargers to the south.  The chargers are adjacent to the Ocean Club hotel parking, and you can easily walk to the Westin.  Wish someone could get these chargers on the map.    There are also some chargers south of the convention center within eyesight of the Sunrise Grill."
I try to piggy back this stop and push for Monroe. Parking lot is always dirty and it doesn't seem like the best location from a security perspective (especially at night)
"I underestimated the battery drain on my Tesla in hot weather. This destination charger has been a life-saver. They mentioned having three chargers, but I only found two: one Tesla destination charger and the other a ClipperCreek. Both chargers are functioning properly."
"I use this charger every time I've come to town this year. It's in great shape and there is at least one available. The hotel is a great, clean, stay. Take a walk on the river or over to downtown Durango while you wait."
I use this supercharger often as it is by my work. Always busy on Friday around 4-5pm. Never busy in the morning. If I get there with 15% or less I get very high charge rate.
"I used the charger near the exit, but it's not fast..
Out of 8 chargers, I was the only one using it, but it was charging at 40kw with 72% battery."
"I used this charger as my villa we were staying at was right behind this Best Western.  Unless you are staying at this motel don't use it. I almost got my car towed even though no one else was using it the   entire week I was staying on the island. Very poor relations, especially a sign posted next to charger stating state government sponsorship of the station. Would never stay at this motel."
"I used this charger for my Bolt EV with Tesla Adapter twice yesterday. I was making a trial run to Atlantic Beach, NC to see if it was possible to drive my Bolt EV on vacation and have access to chargers from the local infrastructure. Right now I would say unless you own a Tesla that can use a supercharger and where you are going does not have a Level 2 charger onsite. You might want to reconsider driving a hybdrid or gasoline vehicle. The Level 3 charging infrastructure is not there for J1772 yet but Tesla has a very good supercharging infrastructure in place already. I love my Bolt EV but I wish I had bought a Tesla now just because of charging infrastructure east of I-95."
"I used this Tesla Supercharger station several times on my Memphis visit.  They have 8 Superchargers and it's a busy station- all 3 times I used it I had a wait of 5-20 minutes.  There are plenty of restaurant choices within a 3 minute walk including: Jason's Deli, Taco Bell, and Amerigo (Italian).  The station is on the east side of Memphis so it was a 20 minutes drive out there when I needed a charge since I stayed near downtown.  Given that this station is busy, it would probably make sense to open a second station in Memphis closer to highway 55 or downtown."
"I usually get good speeds here, however don’t park next to another car if you can leave a spot. This is wired for cabin sharing and it will cut your speed in half. Not sure if there are bathrooms if McDonald’s is closed during nighttime hours"
I usually go early in the morning when I'm in the poconos. Once the outlets open it can get busy.
"I usually stop here when I visit my brother and his family. Very convenient location and easy to get to.

It is located at a Sheetz convenience store. Separate area for charging and a great selection of drinks and food that you can purchase.

Clean restrooms and open 24 hours a day. Sheetz should have more of these"
I visit here a few times a month to charge up. There a few convenience shops and fast food chains in walking distance. Only four spots though so you’ll need to be considerate of other folks.
I visited here last trip and love this Tesla charger.  The Private parking area is behind Wawa and next to Chick-fil-a.  Zaxby’s is across street if you want to grab something there.  There is another charger set on other side of I-95 in old outlet mall so navigate carefully if you are trying to get here.
I visited here on a Weekday evening and there were about 2 stalls open.  Pretty busy though considering its proximity to HEB where you can shop and charge.  Wish more HEBs had Tesla superchargers...
"I wanted to add a photo but completely forgot🙄. When you pull in, it's a BnB. Very historical looking💕. No one questioned me or bugged me about leaving my car there for 2 hours🙏. Follow the driveway to behind the BnB. You'll see one Tesla Charger & one EV charger on your left. Very well kept chargers. Thank you BnB!"
"I was a little nervous coming to this charging station after reading the reviews, but we didn't find it hard to get to. It was about 100 yards from I-81 N and located behind ""The Holiday Inn Express"". There are signs to check in with the front desk to use the restrooms. We didn't go to any of the restaurants. The parking lot was clean and looked well cared for."
"I was able to charge, watch a short video and be on my way. It got me to Marianna for the 2nd recharge and that location is great two if you’re going that way! Made it to my final destination- Pensacola. Made great timing too. We left Leesburg area around 7am made it to Pensacola at 2:30pm and that’s including all the charge times.
Safe travels!"
"I was absolutely surprised to come across this large bank of chargers in the middle of the city

While it is at the edge of the shopping center's parking lot. You can charge your vehicle while you do your shopping"
"I was eating and watching a show, but it was fine. A little slow, as it is an older one. Still pretty fast tho. Gave me time to watch a couple of episodes and take time with my food, and use the bathroom. It's pretty clean, lots of stores.and things around too."
I was getting 32A to charge. Did have to ask the front desk to turn on the charger for a couple hours for me. Just hung out in the library with free wifi while it charged.
I was getting a little worried because I'm out of my driving area good thing I found a Tesla charging station in the target lot in Barstow
I was getting range anxiety as we got closer to the super charger and I was worried about finding a spot and about how fast it would charge because of the previous reviews. Fortunately we found a spot. It charged quickly and it was a good experience. I took 1 start off though because as mentioned in other reviews there are more non electric cars parked here than those that need it. There were plenty of normal spots open but apparently they all prefer the Tesla parking. 1 guy parked here and then went into the apartments behind the store. Lame.
"I was here to take some energy. Walked into two Co Ops. Nice and clean.
Not much to do but, food should not be a problem. And, so should be toilet-ing-ish."
I was in the area and was happy to find a supercharger nearby.  I waited about 8 minutes for a charger to open up. There is also an Evgo charging station with 6 open spots. I don't know anything about EVGO but will explore it.
"I was nearly stranded because my Tesla routed me here when returning from Cape Canaveral. Upon arrival (June 20), access to all of the superchargers was completely blocked off due to resurfacing the parking lot. Not sure where the failure was here but it seems like the in-car navigation should be able to avoid routing drivers to a supercharger when something like this happens. It seems either the land owner didn't notify Tesla of the closure, or Tesla doesn't have the capability to temporarily close supercharging stations."
"I was one of 3 other Teslas waiting to charge. There are insufficient stations available in Ft. Lauderdale.

This is the 3rd time for me.  Are plans being made to add new a  facility or expand the only one in Ft Lauderdale?

Now. the gas station WAMA won't let the public use the bathroom 🤯"
I was one of 4 cars out of a capacity of 12. I was not sharing group ie I was 4b and no one was on 4a. The chargers are supposed to be 250 kw. I have never gotten over 90 at this station and mostly I get 65-72
"I was shocked I even made it here from Winslow during my cross country trip. I am just glad to make it here. It is a nice area. What is funny is coming into town, you just experienced woods, mountains, desert, and then BOOM a home depot."
"I was skeptical about staying here because of the inexpensive rate.... but the nice desk staff I made the reservation with stressed that I should come by and at check it out, because it was very nice. Boy was she right and I'm glad I did !  The place was VERY nice (A lot nicer than Hotels I've stayed at, and been forced to pay MUCH more).... and IN FACT, it was one of the nicer hotels I've stayed at.... and the Value was EXCELLENT !  I utilized the Tesla charger in the rear, and it worked flawlessly, and charged at the advertised higher rate!  The room was great, bed comfy and as a bonus a full breakfast was included.  I almost wish I'd of had to stay another night...  I highly recommend !"
"I was so excited to finally see Tesla’s V3 supercharging in Stafford, VA. It's very clean and right at the Wawa so you can take a break while you recharge plus it's 8 stalls. It's also right off I95 and keep it up Tesla. Glad to know that I now have more options for DC fast charging. 👍👌"
"I was staying in Nashville, Indiana and this was the closest Supercharger. Having only one day in Brown County (Nashville), having to go so far to charge really took a chunk out of my time there. That was sad and it's been the only time that charging was a problem during my trip. Brown County is a popular tourist area and should have it's own Supercharger. There were destination chargers at a hotel but when I called to inquire if I could charge there being that I was staying at a different hotel, the staff couldn't say. I was told that no one had ever asked before! As to this Supercharger, the area was clean and the charging time was average. It gave me peace of mind for continuing on my trip!"
I was the only car charging here on a Monday afternoon. Convenient location for Sheetz or McDonalds while you wait.
"I was the only person here around 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon. Very clean and nice shopping center.

Update: I returned to this charging station twice yesterday (drove from Knoxville to Nashville and back in one day)  and two of the stalls were VERY SLOW (giving me about 200mi/hr of range.) However, the third one I tried on my trip back home to Knoxville was twice as fast, giving me about 400 miles of range per hour. The stall closest to Food Lion was slowest, and the one farthest away was the fastest."
"I was traveling/visiting. Great location, right in the middle of Flemington, and where the 31 & 202 connect.  Gas cars sometimes park in the spots for a while unfortunately.  But there were always open spots. It's behind a Wawa in case you need to buy coffee or other convenience items. And close to a bunch of other stores, restaurants, and a car wash which i needed to use."
I was wondering when Tacoma would finally get a SC. MUCH easier to get into than Federal Way or Northgate.
I wish it would allow non-tesla charging.
I wish my cybertruck was here so I could use this facility 😊
I wish there were a slightly more convenient restaurant and rest room than the McDonald's. The power delivery generally seems solid here.
"I wish they would make it more accessible. Stations are right by the entrance, in front of the plaza, however in order to get there, you need to make several turns and drive behind building, no directional signs either, so I had to guess at first."
"I wish this were closer to the interstate, but it's awesome that it's attached to a Hy-Vee that is open 24 hours. The store has a great selection and easy access to restrooms. There are always a few free stalls for charging and they're usually pretty darn fast. Kind of surprised to see Green Cab there, though. I had thought commercial vehicles were not allowed to use Superchargers.  I won't complain, since it wasn't near full, though."
"I won't be harsh because it's free and regardless if it's working or not: you can still park here and it's closer than handicap parking.  Looks like the one  brand was vandalized, cord cut. They had one Tesla charger and that worked, 48A."
I work at the Marriott and I see 2 on Hawthorn Hotel parking lot. I send guess there all the time when they don't want to go to the welcome center location.
I would steer clear of this one if possible. Make the extra push to Monroe or just stop in for 5-10 mins. There were several people aimlessly wandering around in the area talking to themselves. It looks like a scene from The Walking Dead.
"I wouldn’t call this a SuperCharger because you don’t get the normal 120kW at a regular SuperCharger. My charge peaked out around 70kW, which added roughly 20 min to my overall charge time.

I missed them the first drive by as I was looking for the bright red lit stalls with Tesla plastered all over them. These stalls don’t have anything illuminated on them so they don’t really stand out from the street."
I wouldn’t recommend here people take up space and will not move for other Tesla charger. Also 1/2 of the charger doesn’t work.
I'll give it 5 stars when they open more supercharge stalls. When I went I had to wait 30 minutes to charge which I was not used to and it made me even more mad to see wrapped stalls right next to the chargers.
"I'm ashamed to be seen anywhere near a Tesla, let alone charging one these days. Something about having a thin skinned space Karen in charge of the company is off putting."
"I'm confused about the fuss. We visited a year ago when this was a Hampton and at that time, there were signs in the (very clean and convenient) bathrooms begging Tesla drivers to respect the property and keep the facilities clean. Now it's a Best Western, and those bathrooms are still available and the signs are still there. As far as the hotel receptionist not being welcoming, my husband and I (we entered at different times) were greeted warmly by the gentleman at the counter. Each of us asked if we could use the restroom, so he knew what we were there for.
We were so grateful to have access to clean restrooms (particularly after the reviews we had read) that we bought snacks there. I suggest all Tesla drivers do the same here and support this business."
"I'm having a problem supercharging and have to take the car in to Tesla. In order to do so, I need to fully charge (Knoxville to Nashville requires quite a bit of juice). My wall connector is an hour away (at my office in Cleveland), so Tesla recommended I stop by Embassy Suites and use their destination charger. I hesitated because they probably intend for patrons to use them, but Tesla said it shouldn't be a problem, if it's not busy (and I'm not keeping a patron from charging).

All 6 chargers were open, but I'm only getting 16mi/hr of range. The car says I have another 5hr 45min to fully charge. Are you kidding me?! My wall connector gives me close to 50mi/hr. I can't imagine if there were another Tesla or two charging with me. I guess for guests okay with charging overnight, this would be okay. But this is barely useful. (And I'd be happy to pay them for use of an adequate charger)."
I'm just glad this sits at the top of the parking lot and not where any water pools. That's an accident waiting to happen.
I'm like 90% sure this charging station doesn't exist. Of the countless hours I've spent in town I've never once even seen a glimpse of it.
"I'm loving this Wawa - Tesla Partnership and I love this stop just off I-4 between Tampa and Orlando. You're getting 7 (or 8?) fast (250kW) chargers that are easy to back into and a lovely convenience store with all sorts of drinks, hot food and snacks. The bathrooms are clean (especially if you show up in the morning pre-rush), the food selection plentiful, and there's like a million restaurant options around if you don't want Wawa.

My choice pick? After you're done charging, head down one block and hang a right to get to the Krispy Kreme. It's on the way back to I-4 so it's easy, and they make their donuts on premises, so you can get the tastiest, gooiest yeast donuts right off the conveyor. You fed your car, you should reward yourself with a meal-spoiling treat. It's also the perfect excuse for you to buy some handwipes at the Wawa. :D"
I'm pretty shocked at the high review score.  Most of the Tesla stations are broken.  The two charge points work but at present one of them is ICEd and the hotel will not do anything about it.
"I'm sorry, is it just me, or is there something missing at tesla Chargers? Like trashcans. I've been all over the country with our model 3, and I have only seen 2 stations with trashcans"
I'm very glad this location is where it is and made the drive from Columbia to Kansas City. All that much easier. Kind of tucked away and that's fine. At least there's a Casey's General store there so you can get a snack and drink
"I've charged here before, but today the chargers were out of order. The car displayed a warning stating charger wasn't working.
Last time I was here, the charger was repaired. Overall great location."
"I've had my 2020 model 3 for 3 months now. This super charging location seems to be rated low for several reasons. All I can say is that I'm thankful charging station 3B works. Most superchargers like this work much faster than 86-87 kW. This seemed pretty slow, especially for 9:30pm at night. With my two photos, you can kinda get a view of the area around the charger. I see several buildings under construction. This charging station will probably be better in a few years when this area finishes developing. But as for now, it feels a little sketchy after dark. As several other reviews suggest, I would also recommend skipping this charging location and going straight from Gila Bend to El Centro. Both of those locations provide better options than just sitting in your car... not that sitting in a Tesla is EVER boring! Haha"
I've never had an issue here. Being in the same parking lot as a 24/7 grocery store is really nice.
I've never had to wait for a charging spot! It's nice and convenient.
"I've owned my Tesla for a little over 2 years and I have to say I have never experienced charging speeds so high.🤯🤯 It was definitely very exciting to see charging speeds of over 900 mph.. My only concern was, if this level of quick charging is bad for my battery 🤷🏽‍♂️.."
"I've stopped here many times but only once for charging. This is an EXTREMELY busy stop for ICE cars so chargers are often iced due to limited parking spots for the rest stop. 4 V2 chargers so often there is quite a wait to charge and nowhere for a line to form. Not sure why but across the parkway at a identical   charging/filling station for southbound traffic, not nearly as much activity."
"I've used these chargers a few times, and they are working every time as expected.  They are not the fastest, but they are faster than most in this area."
"I've used this many times with my Model Y. I'd give it 5 stars except for: A: It's up a long, steep mountain road, so it'll eat a lot of juice just getting here from Winthrop. B: The resort has a strict No Dogs policy, so we never stay there.
Great place for hiking in the summer, and XC skiing in the winter. Great views."
I've used this supercharger every time we've gone from Sugar Land to Austin. I've only seen one other cat here once! It's in a good (if hidden) spot. Only improvement would for it to be a v3 (250 kW) charger.
I’m giving the doubletree station a three because it’s a couple hundred feet from the animus (sp?) river making it a nice place to have lunch. Tesla charger is damaged and down. Universal charger works but only at 7kw. It looks like the Tesla charger has been broken for a long time. Doesn’t appear that anyone  is maintaining this station :(
I’m really charged up! What can I say?
I’m sick of seeing litter all over this supercharger station. Tesla needs to provide waste disposal as well or people just need to throw their trash away
"I’ve been here before, not much to eat other than the Dunkin’."
"I’ve been trying to stay at this hotel, as it has 2 Tesla destination chargers, however; I have driven by on several occasions, only to find that these parking spots have been taken. I noticed neon traffic cones adjacent to the chargers (not in the actual parking space), and the chargers are locked (I’m ok with this, as they have a sign stating, guests are to ask personnel to unlock for charging. Curious why they would have cones stacked and not used, for the apparent purpose of leaving these parking spots vacant. When I called to inquire about my situation, I was told that the cords reach up to four parking spaces. I am not disagreeing with this, as I have not put this to the test, but it seemed within reason, however; all four spots were taken on two occasion, by non-Tesla vehicles (or any EV for that matter). I was also told the hotel was at capacity; at capacity did not seem sufficient enough when there was about 10 parkings available. I get the fact that the parking for destination charging was slightly closer than the vacant parkings, due to all rooms being booked. If people are booking rooms, whether it be personal or business, I would think that those who have limited resources for tier 2 charging in Sierra Vista would get some preference over someone who wants to park 10-20 feet closer to the hotel, when there is a gas station less than a 1/2 mile away.

The individual Monica was very pleasant and understanding on the phone.

Not sure if this hotel gets make and model color when checking in; This could easily remedy the situation by contacting the guests at some point. Using the cones would be my first option though…"
I’ve not had any issue there and there a lot of places to eat near by but no trash can. No wonder why trash all over sometimes.  Target should provide some because I’ve seen a lot of charging stations have trash cans because some stupid Tesla owners have thrown trash all over.
I’ve used this supercharger a few times now. No issues and it is well lit at night.
"ICE’d quite often, hotel staff is ok with nonpatrons grabbing a free charge. Located third floor parking deck. Also a J-1772 connection available."
"ICEd out.  As other reviews mention, a few spots are “30 minute general parking” but there were still plenty of ICE vehicles parked in the “vehicle charging only” spots.  Maybe avoid this charger if you are not willing to take the chance."
"If charging your Tesla was always this wonderful of an experience you would want to stop every twenty miles. Christine, the owner, was wonderful and full of positive energy."
"If driving an EV to the Hyatt beware they just allow people to park there and charge for 36+ hours on end with no regulation.  Only 2 chargers available, so if you arrive without enough charge to get anywhere else you are SOL.  We’ve basically been stuck at the hotel because they can’t get people to move their vehicles."
"If full, we came at 3pm on weekday and short line but charge rate was very slow as all chargers full.  Got 43mi/hr on a battery 27% model 3.  However, had to wait to get enough to reach next charger.  If possible would try to skip this one for a less busy one"
"If I could give it a ZERO star rating I would’ve.

This was the closest charging spot in 2 hours. Advertises restroom facilities at the hotel. Was not able to use it, as staff would not allow it. Very unfriendly. Very rude. And overall not a great experience."
If I had a Tesla I would charge my vehicle at this location after going to church on Sundays.
"If it is snowy and cold, you should forget about trying to charge at this station. ICE car owners need to park close to the door so they don’t walk in the cold and snow. Tesla please move this station away from the front door of the store. This is the only supercharger in Sioux Falls and the only one with in 60 miles in any direction."
"If looking for a quick, close meal just go inside fresh thyme and head over to the left side where you can pick up freshly made sandwiches!"
If only I had a tesla
If only people with big trucks didn't think this was funny. . It's a great location for Tesla to have chargers with plenty of NORMAL parking... Yet... People still have to block it.
"If their restaurant is not open, owners will see you charging and come over and turn off the charger from inside.  Do not count on this charger working, people are clearly not a friendly bunch."
"If traveling with kids, this is not the best stop to charge for a long charge because there's really nothing around. The Iron House gym next door kept our 2 yr old somewhat preoccupied with flipping tires outside which was so nice of them. We opted to only charge for 10 minutes and then hit the next stop at St. Charles for a longer charge."
"If you are carrying anything atop your car, be aware that this parking ramp's posted height clearance is only 6' 8"". Our MY LR + Tesla roof rack + Yakima Keelovers + small solo canoe with center depth 11"" cleared the ceilings by a little, maybe a couple of inches. I am not confident that our tandem canoe with center depth 13"" would also clear.

Would love to hear if anybody else had success or not with their canoe in this garage."
"If you are charging late morning or afternoon it’s fine, but rush hour between 6:45-8 is chaotic. Cramp parking due to large moving trucks blocking the charging spaces or lawn companies blocking the parking spaces. This is the most busy Wawa I have been to in awhile. But thankful for a fast supercharger in 15 min from 21%-40%"
"If you are driving from Indianapolis to Detroit ,it’s perfect place to charge. This 10 stall Supercharger is in Meijer’s parking lot. Applebee’s Starbucks and gas station are nearby."
"If you are going east-bound, this is the last Supercharger in Indiana and much cheaper (25 cents) than one in Ohio (>40 cents).   While charging, we had 10 pc fried chicken from the nearby Meijer, it was so delicious and fresh."
If you are going here to charge your car at the Tesla supercharger you will be paying $25 to park as well.
"If you are googling for a charging station in Lake Havasu these are located at the Heat hotel and only available to guests. Do not plan to your trip thinking you will be able to charge here unless you are planning on getting a room there. We learned the hard way. Saw it advertised on Google search, planned our trip thinking we could charge here to learn at 20% of battery that it was only for guests."
"If you are here before 2pm, go to Neutral Ways across the street for breakfast or lunch. Sign says Dells Cafe. There's also a convenience store."
"If you are in a hurry, this is NOT the charger to stop at.

80kW if you are LUCKY. Checked multiple stalls with the same results. Average speed was 74kW.

Only thing this place has going for it is the shopping, IF you get there when stores are open."
"If you are traveling along I-80 this is located between two exits, so get off at one and re-enter further down the highway. The windshield washing stations and large open field for dog walking here are appreciated."
"If you are traveling with dogs this place is awesome. They have bathrooms for humans, dog park for your fury friends and a convenience store to fill up. Love this stop!"
"If you are using a rental, remember to turn on toll roads, only way to access this place."
"If you can avoid it, don’t charge here. It probably doesn’t deserve a 1 star but want to make sure people see this. This is a rougher area that does not appear to be safe, my fiancé did not feel safe there, and after speaking with locals they agreed that you shouldn’t stay the night here. The hotel looked unkempt, construction going on inside, bathrooms disgusting (worst bathroom on our whole cross country trip)"
"If you consider the $5-for-first-hour parking rate to access the chargers, the combined per-kWh rate is competitive with the no-parking-fee Superchargers elsewhere in the city."
"If you consider the mandatory-spending to receive free parking to charge, the charging rate is competitive with the no-parking-fee Superchargers elsewhere in the city."
"If you found my review helpful, please like it 👍🏼. The Tesla Supercharger is found near the back on the parking lot behind Mel's Diner. It's about a 5 minute walk to Grocery Outlet and JoAnn Fabrics if you need something. Overall, safe place and relaxing."
If you get there at the wrong time you will have to wait for all the ICE cars to move before you can get to a charger since the Wawa gas station has  priority 15 minute general parking. The superchargers get crowded and it can be a long wait to get a supercharger in addition to the charge time.
"If you Google this address it will take you The Hotel Hot Springs. These chargers are on the roof of an adjacent parking garage. The entrance is off Church St., across from The ReStore. There are five chargers. The garage was almost empty when I was there (early in the day on a Tuesday.) I was afraid the garage gate might be closed by 5pm. I got there a little after 5 and it was still open. Looking at the lock, it appears the gate never actually closes."
If you like fried chicken you will love this place
"If you need access to a restroom during the 'rona, ray's food place - produce section, black door, to the left and all the way to the back. Thank you ray's! Nice spot with space seemingly always available. Grocery store, restaurants in walking distance"
"If you simply must spend 20 minutes hanging out in a vacant parking lot turned ice skating rink, you could do a lot worse than *this* vacant parking lot turned ice skating rink."
"If you want to use the bathroom, you have to go to a dog bar and sign a waiver with your phone number. Not a good stop"
"If you're coming from the GSP north, you can make a left into the Quick Chek parking lot at the light- the car might try to route you through a neighborhood instead. Quick walk to the Quick Chek and even a shaded grassy area for dogs to walk."
"If you're ever in need of a quick charge, this version 3 supercharger is where to go. A convenient location with amenities. I definitely recommend this Tesla supercharging station."
"If you're facing the superchargers, there's something wrong with the one that's 2nd from the right. We were only getting 36kW out of it and finally switched to another one that's on the other end which was charging at an appropriate level."
"If you're not familiar with the streets in this area, you might miss it, but the location is nicely situated behind a restaurant. It appears that all the charging stations are in good working order, and you really can't beat the supercharger."
"If you're traveling through Atlanta you might want to pass this one. Located in a covered parking garage.   Took a while to get to from I85. Though there's 30 stations there is no signage directing you to them.  You enter through a gate, take a ticket and wander.  Low ceiling and circled around before finding them.  No garage parking fee under 2 hours, thankfully."
"If you've never been to buc-ee's then you're in for an experience with the busiest service station I've ever been in. This time was my first time going and have never been in such a huge gas station, Tesla supercharge spot, and souvenir shop all-in-one. The restroom lines were a little long but the restroom attendants kept everything moving swiftly so the lines went down pretty quickly. Also the cashiers are swift and plentiful to make it easier getting checked out with ease. It is definitely a tourist spot and a place where you can grab a quick bite while on the road. They have different types of sandwiches, salads, tacos, burritos, and sweet treats made up and ready to grab."
"If you’re driving between Minneapolis and Chicago and are hungry, make this your first stop, not Mauston. A little ways off freeway, but it’s a nice stop. Lots of grassy spots for the dog and Panera and Noodle Company for decently healthy food options. Speedy chargers, although a few gas-powered cars took up some spots."
"If you’re not feeling the casino vibe, it’s a 10 min walk to the visitor center at the top of the hill with better restrooms and views. The patches without sidewalks add to the adventure."
"If you’re stopping to charge to head into Truckee, know that this spot will throttle your charge like crazy as soon as you’re at 50% ish charge. 300mph+ charge drops down to below 200 quickly."
"If your bladder is full and you're planning on rectifying that matter once you've arrived at this charger, I have a suggestion for you. Stop at Mary Laveroni Community Park, just down the road, first. There is a sign directing you that way from the parking lot the chargers are in. What the sign does not tell you is how far a walk this is. Let me tell you it is a distance that becomes increasingly more relevant the fuller your bladder is.

Coming from Yosemite the park will be on the right, before you get to the chargers. Coming from the rest of the world, flip and reverse the above.

The chargers are located in the parking lot of a cute shop with a cute sign. Sadly the cuteness of both is rather undercut by the clear notice that the bathrooms therein are not for the public to use."
If your car has a cheeky vanity plate it will charge faster!
"If your going to Cherokee casino, FULLY charge. There isnt another charger ! Clean area. Mall security patrols area. Trash can available.  Waffle House is pretty good also."
"if your staying the night great, but this isn't a supercharger...."
Im always the only car here. Good Location! The Dunkin Donuts drive-thru line is always crazy so you might consider walking over to order inside.
Im gonna be completely honest. If your willing to sit a couple hours go right ahead be my guest. It’s only beneficial for people staying over night at the hotel really. But hey it does the job. 🤷🏽‍♂️
"Immediately off the highway I was traveling on, not busy at all. I was the only person charging the whole time I was there. Truck stop and restaurant available in the same parking lot. Would recommend."
"Importantly, this place has both 150KWH and 250KWH charger (12 each). It was nice trip to the charger. I was expecting delays or slow due to the busy nature of the area but I still got one solo on 150K charger. For my model 3, from 12% to 8% in less than 30 minutes, no complains here. Target and Starbucks on two minutes walk, tempting but I resisted. Well lit and clean,  Overall a good experience. Noisy, I must say but that is because I-440 is just right behind the fence. Fortunately or Unfortunately, this is the only one in Raleigh City limits."
In a convenient store parking lot right off the highway. But tucked in the side and not looking too safe to be here at night. Pros apart from the convenient store is it's a 250kwh charger and it's close enough to Greenville to have a 2nd Supercharger location.
"In a coop parking lots. Clean bathrooms in the gas station. Nowhere to sit and nothing to do, but easy to find."
"In a free parking garage, easy to get to! Not super easy to find a bathroom though"
"In a mall. We were going south, it was on the north bound side. A couple of long turns right off the highway. Multiple stations, clean, easy. Shop Rite for the bathroom. Back to south bound, going to Mystic"
In a parking garage. Less than ideal when traveling. No access to restrooms or any conveniences nearby.
"In a safe, well lit area, you can go to the hotel and get some snacks and refreshments if you need to."
"In a subway parking lot, convenient for food and bathroom break.  Located right off the freeway.   Garbage cans located at charging stations.   No waiting to charge.  I believe there were 10 charging stations."
"In almost 3 years with my Model 3 this was the WORST Supercharging experience I have had.  I use Superchargers to charge fast and be on my way during long trips.  This charger has the following PROBLEMS for me:
1.  It is too far from Route 50 and you have to go through city traffic to get to and from it.
2. It is in a parking garage across the street from a Target and people go there, plug in and LEAVE to go shopping.  I got the last space.
3. To use a bathroom you have to go down 2 levels from the garage and up two levels into the Target.
There is a better charger on Kent Island that is far superior which I will review."
In an area that was not busy. We were able to charge without unhooking our trailer but there was space to drop the trailer if we needed too. There was a Giant Foods store with a Starbucks close to the chargers.
In and out with a quick charge. Kind of a busy area and walking to other places is not as easy as at some charging locations. But there was no problem with access or sense of safety while waiting.
"In front of a nice cafe, Mimi’s that serves bfast lunch and dinner."
In just 2 hours you have a full charge
"In the age of 250kW everywhere around this one, it feels quite slow. I couldn’t get more than 73kW out of it with no one nearby. Lots of places to eat though so that saved it from 3 stars. And you will have time to eat!"
"In the AMC parking lot. Nearby 5 guys, Panera and Primos subs. Target is a short walk. Longer walk to the mall itself"
In the back of the lodge's main parking lot in the valet only area. There are restaurants and such within easy walking distance.
In the back of the Wawa. I wish Tesla wouod place these Suoerchargers in better locations. Steak N Shake - Sonic - Outlet mall s - Walmart- let's go Tesla!!!
"In the Burger King parking lot.  They require a purchase to use the restrooms.  Not very neighborly.

2 years later.  Back again. Sign is gone and they let me use the restroom.  Thanks BK. 👍🏼"
"In the front of the hotel there are 4, all of them vandalized, behind the hotel by the Raquet club4 more only 1 charger work at a very low level even though they are Teslas. You could not imagine such a beautiful hotel cant keep up with people who decide to have an EV."
In the Hilton parking lot only charges 10miles/hr and only 1 out of the 2 chargers work. Talked to the Hilton staff about it 3 times during my 4 night stay and nothing was done.
"In the parking garage at Great Lakes Science Center (near the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame), ground floor. Parking is $11 (or, $9 with entry to the Science Center) but charging is free once you're paid to park.
Two Tesla 240-V chargers, and two standard EV chargers.
Note: the Tesla spots were open, but I saw two gasoline-engine cars parked in the spaces for the EV charge (on a day when the garage was quite full), so you may have a problem charging.)"
In the parking garage from the Marriott. I believe there were 4 or 5 Tesla chargers and it seemed fast.
"In the parking lot for Colleen Street Bakery making treats readily available. Easy to access chargers, but it could be a challenge if you are towing a trailer."
"In the parking lot of a gas station, well lit and the convenience store is easily accessible."
"In the parking lot of Fairfield by Marriott. There's not much in walking distance, so I often pick up lunch at the Wendy's near the Interstate exit so I can eat it while I charge. Other than the location, everything else about the charger is good."
"In the parking lot of smithfield BBQ chicken.  Close to cookout, McDonald's, Wendy's and waffle house"
In the parking lot of the Hyvee with a Hyvee has station
In the parking lot of the residence inn. Very convenient when staying there or at the hotel next door. There are four charging spots and I was getting 10kw. And it's free!
In the sheetz lot in the back corner near the dumpsters. All are working and food and bathrooms are close by
In the St. Regis hotel garage and only available to their guests.
"In Wawa parking lot, 8 charging stations."
Incorrect location and charger type. A local pointed me to the ChagePoint station that is within sight of this spot; and it’s in another parking lot. There are no Tesla stations downtown.
"Incredibly fast, uncrowned, nice nearby restaurant."
Initially we were not getting near 250kW as promised until closer to the end of our charge.  Several restaurants on the way in to grab if you want to eat in your car and not walk.
"Insane amount of superchargers, 40+. More than enough for everyone to plug-in and go! Buc-ee’s is massive and intense so be prepared. It is actually really nice to have the superchargers away from normal parking."
Insanely fast and first handicapped spot I’ve seen and we have taken many cross country road trips! Great idea to have here! In a Wawa lot and the Wawa was clean and staff friendly.
"Inside a casino parking garage, often crowded and not always available. There is a hefty parking fee if stayed over 1 hour"
"Inside a garage and close to high end shops. I was lucky to find an empty spot. The rest seem to be occupied past their charge limit and no drivers. $60/hr parking in a shade for people that are paying $500 for a $20 purse not enough to get them to move their cars.
Its not a bad place just might be full."
Inside a garage apparently as it couldn't be found
"Inside a pay lot, $8"
Inside the first floor of the parking garage. For hotel and condo guests. Tesla connector. Charges fast. 2 out of 4 cords work.
Inside the parking lot of Casey's gas station. They put a trashcan and windshield squeegee by the chargers so you can easily clean your windshields and dispose of trash while you charge.
Interesting place for teslas charge station. Good use of space.
"Intriguing sign from a taco place with a special for tesla owners, a Starbucks, McDonald’s, Perkins and easy on and off from the highway. Well lit stop."
Ironically staged outside of the world's largest gas pump.
"Is a sheets gas station/truck stop. I did NOT use charging ports, but they had several. The store was nice, and the bathroom was clean."
Is hard to find. Is really inside a garage with no signs. And there is only two stations to charge.  PR and Tesla need to invest in more charges.
"Is it just me or is anyone else getting slow charge rate here (M3)? It's just one other car here. Normally get 400mi/hr charge speed (tried two different stalls).

Now just 115mi/hr. Anyone else have this problem?"
Is no wait. It was able to accommodate our trailer without us meeting to unhitch.
Is not open 24/7 as mentioned in add
Is on a golf course so apparently not available at night. Not a lot to do if your not here to golf.  People are friendly.
"Is This A Saturday?
Every Day In Las Vegas, Nevada Seems Like A Saturday !"
Is this real?
"It a well placer supercharger needed in the west Coast. But they price to charge is 46 cents per kilo, that is  higher than when  electricity was more expensive ."
It appears that the 2 Tesla chargers are regularly broken. They blink red and will not charge.  Sorry. However there is a regular EV charger that will work with your adapter 32amp @ 27mph charging
It changed my car. I didn't have to wait.
It charged my car. I really wanted something to drink. But it was too cold to go in to Sheetz. There is a 24/7 Dunkin next door!
It charges you extra from 12pm to 10pm @ .54 cents. Not worth it.
"It costs about 49 cents a kWh which seems a bit overpriced.  Also, it has opaque pricing.  There are no prices listed online or at the charging station.  I foresee new laws coming to at least display the price somewhere before you're billed."
It could stand to be more accessible by foot. That's a bit to walk to culver's
It did the charge thing. Up to 100%. ~460m/per hour rate.
It did what I needed it to do.  Charge!
"It does exist. I was skeptical...
Bunch of good places to eat nearby!"
"It doesn't get more Mom-n-Pop-Shop than this. This oversized convenience store and gas station (Stuckey's) now has 250kW (fast) superchargers! With a Dairy Queen, clean bathrooms, tons of cheap candy and more knickknacks than you can shake a stick at, it's likely that your Tesla will be done snacking before you're done having a look around. If there's a downside, it's how dark and quiet the lot gets late at night. If there's an upside, you get to park your Tesla under the price of gas and enjoy your way cheaper fill-up. :D

The store does close at some point, like other reviewers have said. However, Google says  that's at 7:30 and I was still taking pictures there at 8:50 PM, so there may be seasonal variance.  If you're locked out and need to use a restroom, I suggest driving across the overpass and drop into the Love's Travel Stop.  Past that, this place is a goldmine if you like retro candy, astronaut ice cream diecast cars and cheap souvenirs. It's not often you get the country store feel with your supercharging, so I think this is worth the stop!

(P.S. Also, this is South Carolina, so don't be surprised to see a ton of pro-gun humor and college team signs available for sale/as decor. That may make an uncomfortable environment for some. As someone whose politics generally doesn't align with the signage, I would encourage others to also judge the stop by the people inside. I found the night staff to be friendly and the other customers politely disinterested what I thought about.)"
It doesn't show on here which one this review is for...on my end.  But I have had a good experience at all chargers so far.
It elwetwic
It gets the job done for charging your car. There is some stuff close by but still wished EVs would get a proper rest area and service plaza.
It got the job done but OBX really needs some fast chargers.  Those traveling from long distances have to spend well over an hour to charge in order to get to the next charger off the island.  Granted I'm super thankful this is here and it's better than most but I hope they start to replace these with the bigger ones.  Also it's convenient to charge while you arrive for your weekly grocery shopping.  Super easy to find and use!
"It got the job done, but was the slowest charger that I've been at since I got my car. In fairness, I knew the speed of the charger was going to be slower, but it was really slow and there was only 1 other car charging in the entire bank at the time."
"It had plenty of spots and enough power to charge my car and then some! I definitely would recommend this place to people who have cars that run on electricity or those who like watching people charge. There's a Starbucks, a dog friendly Lowe's, and a Subway."
It had snowed but it wasn't plowed close enough the chargers and it made it difficult to get close to plug in
"It has 8 stalls super charger. They locates behind the gas station. There are McDonald ,Subway, and Tim Horton closed-by. But only Tim Horton is open 24 hours with limited items available for late night. If you need washroom, you can go to Tim Horton if it is late otherwise, subway also has washroom available."
"It has a canopy so you are sheltered from the rain. It is also in the parking lot of a decent sized gas station. It is well lit and clean.  We got there around 10:30 pm on a Friday night. The gas station was busy as if it was the middle of the day. This station had ample snacks and drinks, like the perfect place to charge and get refreshments for yourself. The charging area wasn't crowded, so we got in easily. I would definitely recommend this if you are in the area!"
"It has a little trail and park for kids while waiting to charge! We didnt get to use the bathroom but there is a hotel in front of it, gas station is just a couple buildings away…"
"It has been out of service for 4 weeks.  The first 3 weeks, it wasn’t marked on the map.  After reporting it again last week, I was told it would be repaired a week ago today.  This charger is important as there aren’t any within 30-45 miles."
"It has restrooms for my wife and a great grocery store. Ate sushi in the tesla. If you come late at night, BYOBB (bring your own bathroom bucket)!"
"It is a 150kw stall. They do get busy and have a ""short wait"" during the weekend holidays. Please follow the charging etiquette to allow others to maximize the charging rate. Especially for those who are on road trips and out of town."
It is a good charger but you have to pay $6 for the garage which I absolutely do not enjoy
"It is a great place to recharge. I stopped here twice on my last road trip. The rest stop isn't fancy, but it is fully equipped and has decent hot food and clean bathrooms. That's more than you can say for most places. It's pretty typical in that it's surrounded by basically nothing, but at least as close to the highway, so you can stop grab a bite, empty your tank, and top up the car pretty efficiently."
"It is a parking garage. With fast supercharging. There's also ample parking near the charging stations to park after charging to avoid idle charges.

Great location to charge with many shops, restaurants, activities, and even just walk around and sightsee.

Turn left immediately when you enter the garage to go down to the 2nd level."
"It is a supercharger.

There is a Subway, Tim
Hortons, McDonald’s. Nothing else within a ten minute walk."
It is actually located at the rear of the building next to Home Depot.
It is at the back of Best Western and Chargers at 8 kW per hour. Great if you’re staying at the best Western. Only so so if you are eating at the restaurant.  There are 2 Tesla chargers and 1J charger.
It is extremely convenient. There are two Tesla destination chargers next to two Chargepoint stations. Easy to recharge overnight.
It is good experience I call them and ask about charging my model x and how much is going to charge me lady tell me it’s free to charge I was surprised to hear free word wow
"It is in a hotel parking lot like most reviews say but they do have restrooms inside the hotel. I walked right in and used it with no problems at all. When you walk in you see the snacks and stuff in front, head to the right of that and they are right there. Pretty hard to miss. No food or anything that close so that's a huge bummer and the superchargers are busy alot of the time which is a bummer considering it is a V2 supercharger which means you share power with your neighbor (1a shares with 1b, 2a with 2b and so on). It has also told me that all but one charger is available until I pull into the parking lot then it has told me two available and one of the two was broken."
"It is in the parking lot of El Bracero Mexican restaurant just off the interstate,  except the ramp was under constructing when we went there so it was the ""scenic"" route to get there."
"It is located in the Irving Blue Canoe Big Stops with next door restaurant and minimart. The bathrooms are nice and clean.

There are 8 stalls here."
It is nice.....
It is pretty good just the bad thing when i went like in 2017 or 2016 they didnt have supercharger
"It is public and in the very back of the building,
but the charger is breaking apart: the prongs are all messed up almost bent my car port and plus the charge is slow* (not a super charger). Only one available and would've taken 5 hours to gain 60% charge. I drove the hour to Waco and got free coffee while I shopped... #Better"
"It is rated at 150kw but that is INCORRECT - it was essentially vacant, and after trying 4 different charging ports (making sure I was using a unique#) the best charge rate I could get was 73kw (2022 MYP) at about 35%,  preconditioned.  Something seriously wrong with this charger station."
"It is situated in a small strip mall surrounded by some popular restaurants a really nice grocery  store and a woods  coffee shop. The only issue is that because it was placed there recently the area in which the Tesla charging station is at, is used as a Swift way to cut through the parking lot. You are treated as an intrusion while trying to back into a space."
It is so convenient off I-40. Literally you take a right of the exit and it is the first thing on the left. It’s in the Smithfield Chicken and Biscuit Parking lot. Has picnic tables and 12 charging spaces.
"It is well located. Unfortunately you it js in a pay-to-park garage that is not 24 hrs. The chargers work fine and there is always a spot to park. It is in the parking of Target.

SR+ will fully charge in about one hour. Make sure to keep an eye on the charging as you don’t want to stay longer as Tesla will make you pay for idle time."
It is winter I understand but I only got 100 kW for charge
"It located at the back of Wawa, which is right next to a shopping center, off HWY 202. I came around 11:30 pm. I was a little bit skeptical about the environment. All the chargers are at the back of the building.  But it was good.  It was charging at 130KW thing.  It was clean, well maintained."
It looks like 4 superchargers total. But y'all know I ain't got Tesla money. I stopped to use the restroom and got a beef stick. My car didn't need to stop I got a tank that takes me at least a hundred miles further than the long range Elon-mobiles.
"It looks like Tesla and Smithfield’s has some type of partnership because I’m seeing a lot of stations behind Smithfield’s parking lots. We stopped here and it was great. It was late and I was the only car there. All the stations worked, and with a max of 250kwh it was charging over 925mph. I went to the bathroom, got a drink and by the time I got back it was charged past what I needed to get home. Much better experience than what I had in Raleigh."
"It looks like you have to have a reservation here to charge. I didn't verify, but the charger is in a garage behind their door."
"It must just be the culture around this area but this is the nastiest SC I’ve ever been to. Every time I stop here to charge there are mounds and mounds of litter and Garbage all over the ground. I’ve been to 3rd world countries that are cleaner than this place. Also, the traffic getting in and out of this place is abysmal!  If you are on a road trip and are considering this as a charging stop, I’d choose an alternate location."
It okay
"It says 250kw max, but in reality you get around 50kw. Which pretty much forces you to go shopping at the outlets since it will take over an hour to charge it to full before heading back home."
It says supercharger 250kw but it averages 65 kw up to 100 kw so I don't know.
"It seems everyone hates this charging area due to parking fee. You get charge if stayed more than 60 minutes. I have a model S, and it is hard for me to reach the ticket. Lighting is good at night. It is covered so not much snow. It has 14 chargers with 150kw as of 01/23."
"It seems like a small Supercharger with only four stall, but I frequently come through there and never had to wait.
It is in the parking lot of a hotel, there is a gas station with convenience store across the street. Not many food options nearby to grab a quick meal. I usually pick up some food on the way and eat sitting in the car while charging. My go to place is Best Burger. Tasty burger and 3 styles of fries available."
It seems that there is NO SUPERCHARGER HERE AT ALL
"It seems that this charger has been switched out.
It’s a ChargePoint now."
"It states these are the 250kW chargers, but it never got over 120kW charging with no one else charging. The pro is there is a Chick-fil-A in the parking lot... Zaxby's accross the street..."
"It took me 40 minutes to charge from 55 to 90% at this Tesla super charger. Cost me $11.00
First time at this charger. Is that correct to spend thos much time?
This is located at a Wawa super store."
It usually has several people using it when I stop by and I've asked a few people if they like it and nobody has had anything bad to say.
It was a busy station.  It appears that all of the chargers were functioning
"It was a good charger, charged my roommates Tesla really quickly"
It was a little unclear at first but the two charging stations are outside the Best Western Annex behind the McDonald's. Great in a pinch if you drag through headwinds that decrease your range heading south from Albuquerque to Truth or Consequences.
"It was a pretty good experience. This is what charging is supposed to be. It took around 45 minutes for me to go from think around 20 percent to 100% oh well, just playing around on my phone and waiting for the car to be charged"
It was a supercharger. It was about 50% utilized and got to meet some other nice Tesla owner.
"It was a very busy charging station due to the fact it's the only one in town, but we were able to charge our car with ease and convenience."
"It was amazingly busy. But, the charger works extremely fast. We added 200 miles and very short order. This is really fantastic. It's the first time I traveled a long distance in the car and I was very pleasantly surprised."
It was at over 40 something kW 175mi/hr I didn’t fill up was charged little less than 10 bucks. Many spots and seemed like a safe area.
It was easy to find - you have to drive around and behind the buildings and it was a charge in the 140s.   I went after 11pm and it was open - no security gate or any number to call like prior reviews say. Maybe they changed it since then.
"It was easy to find, well light and super fast, and clean. got a little over 20% charge in 5 min"
It was fine and it did the job. It was just a little bit off the beaten path. Kind of far away from convenience stores was on the back side of a hotel down kind of a side road. It was fine. I just wish there was maybe some more stuff close by
It was fine except for people parking at the chargers that are not charging.
It was good and fast with the bonus of a delicious Italian panini and a great Wawa coffee 😋
"It was great, charging was quick, efficient and ready to go another few hundred miles within a few minutes."
It was great.
It was in a good location 48 amp.  Served its purpose.  Did not plan on going out but had to so charge was going to be teens for miles left.  Got home with 25 perfect
"It was in good location overall, we went to bowling center to use the bathroom. Food wise, it's walkable."
"It was kinda plowed here after the snow. With snow tires, no problem to reverse in. Dennys was still open when we arrived and used their facilities. 4 star because when Dennys closed at 11, there were no options for drinks, bathrooms, or snacks. Not a huge fan of the location because of that,  otherwise it was great"
It was mentioned as 120kw but in fact it has 250kw chargers. Charging was fast.
It was nice to see Speedway had multiple charging stations in place for electric cars
"It was open 24 hours, but little bit harder to find after all the surrounded shops were closed"
It was Sooo slow!! We were in spot 3A and could only get 21kw charging power.....we moved to 1A spot and started getting 100kw. It was really terribly long charging here. Positives are: There are some food places nearby and lots of area to walk around while you're waiting.
"It was there, it charged, we are good."
"It was working as expected, be careful for the mosquitoes in the area. We left our car open when charging, and the way back was painful"
It was. Well maintained. I only saw the area I did not utilize it.
It wasn't too bad pretty busy spot fresh mc Donald's nuggets nd fries so that's a plus even got to see a few teslas plugged in this time
It wasn’t being used at all as other reviews had experienced but I did stop at 10 pm it was like 150kW
"It worked as expected. Busy, but no wait. Nice parking lot. Easy to run into Wawa and grab a drink while you charge. 10/10 A+++"
"It worked great as far as giving me a strong signal, but it caused my phone to use it and my plan minutes from my phone provider simultaneously. I had to switch my phone directly back to the router to fix my problem. So even though the device worked, i know my phone (Android) is brand new and works great with wi-fi, just not with the supercharger."
It worked great for me today. I was able to charge at 40amps and gain roughly 30mi+/hr. Docking a star because I'm concerned if it has issues they may not be likely to address it for a while or notify anyone. It worked out great for me while I went and road trails at fire mountain on the onewheel.
It works and is at a Meijer store. Decent stop. Depending on the direction you are coming from you may need to go through a few roundabouts.
It works and is pretty fast. Big compared to most in the area.
It works great but it's usually in use. No public bathrooms but it's a pleasant 15 minute walk to several restaurants.
It works!
"It would be a nice supercharger if it was just the location (right off the highway and visible from the road). It would be nice just counting the number of stalls (24). But it’s also a Buc-ees which makes it a great stop on any journey. But of a walk to get to the front, but worth it."
It would be the perfect place to charge if there were a coffee shop.
"It would’ve been better if the gps hadn’t turned me up into Outback Steakhouse. Do not be fooled people. GPS’s lie. 🤪
Lots of shopping at this location. Highly recommend. Target Marshall’s. Longhorn steakhouse."
"It's a 150KW with 8 stalls.  In parking lot of several stores, however restrooms not easily accessible and that probably contributes to the smell nearby.  Also no trash can, but all charges appear to be functional. Not many options in surrounding area."
"It's a bit slow, and it's on the first floor with no signs anywhere.  Route through the map is not accurate and you end up under the location.  It is a good location to grab food as plenty of options around."
"It's a car charger. For my second experience with such a service, ever... It was mediocre."
"It's a charging station that has 6 superchargers. We arrived here at around 2:40 a.m. on a road trip and I have to say I was very pleased. It initially said it was going to take 45 minutes, but it got it done in around 38 minutes. Our model 3 was at 38 miles when we arrived and got us to full charge (212 miles) in that amount of time.   Given that it is a university town, it was very safe as well although I would not recommend stopping anywhere at 2:40 a.m. no matter where it is."
"It's a charging station. In terms of the plaza, there is hot pot, a Walmart, all you can eat sushi, a Vietnamese restaurant, Mexican food, t4 (boba), Korean food that just opened up, and same with the wings place. Right across the street there is Starbucks and more boba if that tickles your fancy.

There are sometimes these dumb ""Tesla owner club"" meet up that takes up charging spots for people who actually need it. Been approached by one which is extra terrible. I hate them and I don't think they're self aware of the circle jerking they do which gives off a bad representation to Tesla owners.

Overall it's fine as a charging place. There could be worst I guess but the Sacramento owners club is extra cringe."
"It's a few turns off of the highway, but Sheets is a great location for the charger. Food, drink and clean restrooms. 150 kW max."
It's a functional destination charger. There's a key on the electrical equipment on the side of the building that you have to turn to activate the charger. They inform you about that once you go inside the restaurant.
"It's a good location distance-wise along the interstate for a supercharger.  There's a convenience store there, and McDonald's across the highway.

However, not all of the stations always work and some stations cut off before the charge is complete.  Additionally, the charger location has a fine gravel surface, not paved.

Best part: after you've driven across Iowa and Nebraska, when you get to Brush, you realize Denver isn't too much further."
It's a good stopping point. Rarely iced. The bakery makes this a nice stop for picking up a little something different as a snack rather than the typical convenience store.
It's a good Supercharger. Even has one of those rare nose-in chargers. It can be a bit slow but also a quiet place so no worries there.
"It's a great location but the chargers are slower than expected. This is supposed to be a V3 but it peaked at 148KW.
Bathrooms are in the Neon Marketplace"
It's a great place to park your F250 when all the normal spots are taken
It's a little challenging to find the spots. They're in the B area of P2. But the food in the mall above the chargers is awesome!!! Highly recommend the chargers here because you can get great food nearby.
"It's a must see to believe, really good hot food I had a chopped barbecue beef brisket sandwich really well made right in front of me, and a nice fudge bar and sweets counter if that's your thing, great memorabilia, and souvenirs lots of people, 120 fuel pumps, 53,000 ft is very large store hot coffee. Off of i-75 in Georgia"
"It's a perfectly fine Supercharger and there are lots of restaurants and businesses in the area.  BUT, the location is gonna throw you off, so let's get that out of the way.  It's at the back corner of a hotel that's at the back corner of the area.  You will have to walk probably further than you'd want to get to a restaurant or a gas station.  The hotel will allow you to use the bathroom, but that's really as far as you'll probably want to go from your vehicle.  Having said that, just sit in the car for 20 or 30 minutes and then go to one of the very nearby businesses.  I'm so happy this is here because we'd be in a tough spot while traveling this way if it wasn't!"
It's a place to plug in your car.  How can that be bad?
"It's a supercharger location, but nowhere near the best. People shopping or eating there take or block the charging spots."
"It's a supercharger station. Pretty decent since not many Tesla's are in the area, so there is never a wait...lol"
"It's a Supercharger. Not much to say. Although my GPS took me to the front of Hy-Vee when the Supercharger is in the back, it's parallel to the Starbucks drive thru. Hy-Vee has their own electric chargers but you don't wanna use that for your Tesla when the Supercharger is right there. I believe there are 8 superchargers here so definitely a lot for now and you probably won't be waiting."
"It's a Tesla super charger, 150 KW,  99.9%+ uptime at each station. The Cost plus world market is really close and fun to browse and they have different cold beverages than you find anywhere else."
"It's a Tesla Supercharger on the east coast, which in our experience always have open spaces. Nothing to complain about."
It's a vast and colourful place.
"It's about time we got a supercharger on this side of the water. It's behind the WAWA gas station and has 8 stalls, i think."
"It's actually only 35kW, 8 times slower than the advertised 250kW. I've been here about a dozen times and every time the same slow speed."
"It's an easy to find charging station, with clean bathrooms and a convenience store next to it.  There's a McDonald's across the street and another coffee shop a few minutes walk away."
"It's an ok place to charge, at a decent time during the day but why in the hell would Tesla choose this area for Supercharging? Its behind(between) 2 buildings in a back alley...not so safe if you're traveling to another destination and have to worry about being robbed or mugged behind these buildings. Use at your own risk especially at night. I'll also add it is well lit behind the buildings....Thats why i gave it a 3 star..."
"It's an older charging station so it was on the slower side. Then someone pulled in beside us and it really slowed us down. We were able to charge enough but what typically is only a 15 minute stop at other super chargers was a 30+ minute stop. There was a variety of shopping around so if you need to pass the time, there were options."
It's at a Sheetz. Very useful
It's at one of our regular stops
It's behind the Safeway. Did some grocery shopping while vehicle was charging.
"It's close'ish to Tillamook, which is great, but it's far enough away that your car will be charged by the time you walk back.  Hopping the fence makes it a bit shorter of a walk."
"It's currently Mormon Cricket season, so if you're arriving around the time of this review... Know that this parking lot in particular is a HOT bed of the swarm. You will see large crickets mate, fight each other, and resort to cannibalism all from the safety of your Tesla.
Otherwise good location with amenities nearby."
It's fast I got just under 200kw!
It's funny reading all the people complain about everything BUT the charging station in this review. It's a charging station... I for one am glad that St. Johnsbury has it's own Tesla Supercharger.
"It's great when there aren't 20 other Tesla's needing to charge too. This location is the most popular and is always busy. There needs to be more superchargers along I-15, especially some need to be added in American Fork and Saratoga Springs."
"It's great. It's free. If only one Tesla is charging, it charges at the max AC power the car will accept - 11.6 kW. This yields 44 miles range per hour of charge.(If the A/C is not running)"
It's hidden behind a bush!
It's in a bay door. So be prepared to move it semi comes to drop off load.
It's in the parking lot of the Bayshore mall it's cool I drove by haven't actually drove one of the Tesla's but maybe one of these days.
It's in the Wind River Beck parking lot. There are about 4-5 of them.
It's just a bit dark when charging at night. no lights around.
"It's located right in front of Arhaus furniture, in case the GPS isn't quite getting you there properly.  There are plenty of stations and I've seen the max charges often (for mine that's 155kw).  It's also convenient if you want to grab a bite to eat at the many places in the arboretum.  It's easy in and out and the highway is nearby.  Great location."
"It's near amenities, a gas station, some fast food, and right off the highway.  Not much to complain about.  There's a Starbucks inside the casino down the street - if you want coffee you could get it from there first before you go to the supercharger."
"It's near and there's always spots for charging,love it 👍👍"
"It's nice having another supercharger (an Oasis in a desert really) in the city. But I've never gotten over 85kw, even on a 250kw charger. So don't expect to be in and out. Try to come in off peak for better results? Good luck!"
It's not 16kw its showing only 7kw......
It's not 250kW.  It's charging at 70kW
"It's not really near anything so it's boring to charge.

On the other hand it hasn't been busy when we have used it."
"It's not right off the interstate and there aren't many choices for food. The good news is that the charging speed is fine and there's a 24 hour Meijer you can go to for bathrooms, food, and basically everything else if you need it :)"
"It's not tough to find,, you enter in level 2,  and then before you exit level 2 , there is right turn to go to level 3 and keep going you will find it..."
"It's ok. The hotel door nearest the superchargers is locked, so I couldn't use a restroom there, but I went to the Cracker Barrel across the street for lunch. It's safe to cross the road on foot. Plenty of open chargers."
It's okay there's a bp but the bathrooms are awful they smell and sinks were not working. There's an Arby's next door and that seemed okay didn't eat there but could see it
It's on the 5th Floor. Get parking validated in Burlington on the 2nd floor. It's a validation box by the cashiers. Free for 90 minutes.
it's on the ground level of the parking lot in the shopping center. The chargers are located in the parking lot inside the shopping center. The parking lot allows you 30 mins without paying but anything more than that be prepared to pay for parking. Who h would be my only complaint really but usually you would be here more than 20 mins I less you're filling up completely. Good place for a quick stop.
"It's on the side of a Wawa, super fast charging with ez and quick access from I-95. Not much ambiance, well lit, plenty of driveway space for ez backing in and driving out of your spot. Be aware ICE cars can cross en route to the gas pumps somewhat quickly...look both ways for the penguins on ICE ;-)"
It's on the side of Wawa and there are several spots
"It's only 150 Kw and nothing much else around but it charges my car.
I understand that a 250 kw is slated to be installed soon in another location in Billings."
It's only a 150 so not super fast but it gives you It's all. It's also at a Sheets so you have everything you need right there.
"It's only a 150KW so this is a good place to get dinner at the nearby restaurant or take a nap. I think they recently installed lights at the charging station, so if you plan to sleep at night in your car you may need a light block. There are several trash cans at this station which is nice. The truck stop across the street usually has clean restrooms. The liquor store has a good selection of bourbon and keeps their allocated stuff in the display case."
It's open!
"It's open! Super fast charging at 8 Tesla superchargers, aslo has a couple EV charging. The parking lot needs a little repair, but since it's in the Target parking lot I can forgive that. 😁"
"It's pretty pathetic that you have to drive soooo far to find a Tesla supercharger around Dallas. It's crazy to me that small little country towns have more of them. Most the chargers around Dallas are basically wall chargers. No, thanks 😊 I have a wall charger in my garage. And  yes This location has great chargers. Life saver on a Monday. It's located at the very top floor of the garage."
"It's right off the highway so that's good.  However, I'd skip this one if you can adjust your charging route.  It's not in a wildly comfortable location in terms of surroundings, it's unpaved / unmarked charging spots, and there is not much nearby to walk to.  I probably wouldn't want to stop here at night personally."
"It's so much better to charge quickly at a Tesla supercharger than to have to buy gas. Most of the chargers are very convenient to food, but every one of them has been near somewhere with a restroom."
It's super and full of charge! Thanks Elon!
It's the only Supercharger around. The lot usually gets cleared fairly quickly during snow. There is a weird dip in one portion of the lot that should probably get fixed. I think it is where they ran the power lines.
It's ultra fast and positioned in a nice lit parking lot. The area is always clean and available. This is the best one in Colorado  damn near!
"It's very hard to find, and it's in a crowded place.  Avoid this place if you are going to hear it from a long distance.  By the way, this is on the 2nd floor of the indoor parking lot."
"It’s 1$ an hour to charge.
You NEED to pay inside and they NEED to be open to use this charger.
It’s not fast but I was driving down from Powder Mountain and this saved my day. After the drive up I would not have made it back to my hotel with the range I had."
"It’s 2$ per hour to enter the parking garage. Charger is located on the 2nd floor. This is not the safest area of Oakland (but what area is...). Do not recommend walking to downtown or lake Merritt from here, esp at night. DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING IN YOUR CAR. Oakland has very high car burglary rates, consider sentry mode. It’s a clean garage. Recommend this charger if you absolutely need a charge."
"It’s a busy travel day, and still 7 slots are available that good enough for charging car and the passengers. It’s convenient to be so close with Wawa!"
It’s a decent charging station near a lot of things. But only person here and I can’t get above 36kw at any of the charging stations. So frustrating.
It’s a good spot if you are going to take some time to eat or go to the mall. But just for traveling its a v2 so it’s pretty slow. Paired stalls slow down everything when someone doesn’t understand how that system works.
It’s a great station. Very convenient and nice shopping area. Easy to find.
"It’s a mixed bag here, the actual charging area is OK and far enough away from problem areas. But since COVID, there has been a drastic decline in safety, cleanliness and the overall point in even going to this rest stop anymore.

The standalone Starbucks across from the Tesla charging area is extremely slow and closes by about 5pm every day. The Starbucks inside the Delaware rest stop is now closed. Other food chains inside the rest stop are frequently closed. Bathrooms are frequently closed and 100% always filthy.

The parking lots are frequently full of sketchy characters, panhandlers, and garbage.

Come here to charge but don’t get out of your car is my advice."
It’s a supercharger station. Plenty of stalls. I’ve used this station a few times and rarely seen another Tesla. Will visit again.
"It’s actually there! We were scared we would end up in the middle of nowhere and our Tesla was running on metaphorical fumes. Got there late at night and in the pouring rain— but it worked and gave us just enough power to get home. The station is to the right as you’re approaching the main house, behind a bush near a garage. A few different charging options, it’s not just Tesla. Thank you!"
It’s behind a double tree and across the street is a Cracker Barrel. The main road has fast food options and gas station snacks with plenty of hotels nearby.
"It’s behind the Circle K gas station, directly across from the diesel gas pumps. GPS kept taking me around and around."
It’s broken
It’s broken
"It’s charging only at 75 kW, even though it says it can charge up to 150 kW.

Just be ready to wait little longer for charging.

I might try Hood River city charger next time as it shows only 22 miles from here and have up to 250 kW charging speed."
It’s close by and you can sit down inside of the Sheetz Store while waiting
It’s conveniently located next to Target. What else can I say? :)
"It’s definitely hidden but not difficult to find. As mentioned in a previous post, restrooms are inside the main lobby, second door on the right as you walk towards the entrance of the hotel. The lady at the front desk is very helpful and polite. Snacks are available to purchase at a reasonable price. Hotel seems very clean and judging by the condition the restrooms were in I wouldn’t doubt staying here. A++"
It’s extremely slow.
It’s fine.  By 730 am on a Sunday all chargers were occupied. Plenty of snacks at the Wawa .  It’s a sketchy area - strip mall city off of I-95 ..did the trick
"It’s fine. Fred Myers doesn’t excite, but it’s a place with bathrooms and food. The pull straight in charger did not work, but the next one we tried did."
It’s generous of the college to expand EV charging in town. Here the J1772 plug did not work on my Chevy Bolt because the plug is broken. The Tesla charger however works.
It’s good but we need to wait on the line and I was aspected it’s going to be fast like 5 or 10 minute to charge it but no it’s take longer like an hour and city doesn’t have god enough charging place
It’s got a nice grassy area for letting your dog out! It’s slightly low though so if it rained recently small parts might have a little standing water.  The tesla charger isn’t as fast some down the interstate a little farther in either direction but it still works and the area is always kept clean!
It’s great that there are destination chargers downtown but you have to be a guest and the security guard isn’t a fan of non-guest “using his Tesla chargers” as I found out :-)
It’s great they have these but you really can’t depend on them as they are often ICE’d.  No signage on the spaces.
It’s handy to have in the area and costs $20 at the office. It’ll take 4+ hrs to get a full charge though.
It’s in the hotel. Go through the gate
"It’s in the Wawa area but the store close at 11 pm and was a waste of time for me.
Because I stopped her just to go an get my sub and use the restroom on my way to west Plam beach"
It’s nice place and I stopped here every time I passed by but on a Wednesday I got here around 7ish pm.  The place was closed.  Where is said that it’s open 24hours. My car and 3 others was stranded.  Tesla road side assistance quote me $600 to toll my car to the next charger which is 34 mile to Lafayette.
"It’s nice! 3$ all day parking which I don’t mind. And it’s a protected space within a parking garage next to a large mall. It’s relaxing, I grabbed some chipotle close-by and kicked back while I caught that smooth charge."
It’s ok.  Ideally a 250kw unit would be more ideal.  Gas station and restroom near units.
"It’s on LL2
(Level below destination chargers)"
It’s only for customers so don’t rely on it unless you’re in the mood for some Italian food
It’s OPEN. The main entrance to the casino is closed but you can drive down the driveway you normally exit from to get to the super charger. There is usually a security vehicle there to police that only Tesla’s are entering the grounds
"It’s perfect that the chargers were nearby, but since we went at night there was nothing to do"
"It’s perfect.  New,  clean   Behind Sheets station .."
It’s quite and calm. Almost always have several spots available
"It’s quite, and fast."
"It’s really dark and freaky her at night.

This place is kind of hidden and many times it’s does not come up on the map as a choice.  About 5 miles away there is a really great smoothie and açaí bowl place called Blended Berry."
"It’s still free parking for the first hour, starts costing $15 after that. Confirm supercharger availability ahead of time and you won’t be there for more than 45 min anyways."
"It’s such a scam! You need to pay for parking 7$ and then they valet the car into charching    And you can’t be in your own car.  you have to seat on a bench outside. I really needed that rest/nap in the car. And they don’t have a restroom. Ahhh

Never again I’ll come here and all other San Francisco superchargers

Tesla pay attention!"
"It’s tricky to find , but look at the pictures of building it might can help you . Name of building is 166 Green office. But one only one is working, in same building there is another single charging station in corner.
It’s pretty slow but good to charge little bit to continue trip"
"Its a 250 kwh charger site but even after changing multiple stalls i was down to 70kwh.
It did start with 140 (listed 250 kwh)...only to drop to 70 later.
There were only 3 more cars charging in entire site (over 12 chargers in total)"
"Its a supercharger.  It works. Its fast.  Its convenient.  But lets be honest, if you can use a supercharger then you probably already know all this already! If not, well now you do!"
Its closed
"Its convenient and provides the advertized function. Its convenient because as you waste time daily recharging your Tesla, you can do other things, like shop or get a massage nearby. No doubt you will have plenty of time spent in those spots when you could be doing something more productive"
Its good to see a charging station in Rochelle  Illinois. The location is pretty central and easy to get to from the highways.
Its in the parking lot opposite to Albertsons.. always available one for charging
Its Tesla charger isn’t a supper charger it is a very slow charger designed for all day or all night charging only!
"Ive been driving by it since the beggining of its construction, waiting patiently for it to open. Charging my car as i review. Close to food and shopping! So happy it's finally open!"
J1772 charger is located on the end for Jeeps with 4xe technology.  This way Jeeps and Teslas can peacefully coexist ✌️
Junk.
"Just 8 superchargers but Buc-ee’s is right down 35, which has 40+ superchargers. Abbott’s Travel Center is more chill than Buc-ee’s too!"
"Just a basic 50amp charger, located at the main office."
"Just a heads up for EV owners; there isn't a charging station at this location. If you come to Granville in expectations of charging your EV while you visit, then you're going to be disappointed."
"Just a heads up that this charger is in the hotel and is only available for hotel guests (or you have to pay $20 to charge not as w hotel guest). Not bad, but just good to be aware."
"Just a quick drive off the I-10 this Tesla Supercharger offers you alot to do while you charge. Food, shopping, banking, even get a massage.

A flat rate of $0.45 / kWh it's not the cheapest charger, but certainly not the most expensive. Sixteen stalls pushing 250kW will have you back on the road quickly with a full battery."
"Just drove by it, did not use, no cars using it"
"Just fine. Meijer parking lot. Also near a hotel, Applebees"
Just happened to drive by here. Do not have an electric car.  I am amazed at where i see these available to the public...makes me consider going electric!
Just here to say I'm getting 109kw charging at 398 mph while there are 3 other cars here so I'm not sure why others are saying you'll only get 20 if there are other cars. Parked on the 2nd charger on the left side.
"Just inside, after you turn the first corner.
Charging is free but you do have to pay to access the garage (same with all the Norfolk public garages that have charging) but it's not too expensive ("
"Just left this supercharger station. We arrived at 8am so there were lots of chargers available. Scheels was still closed so there wasn't much for us and the kiddos to do while we waited. We were fully charged to 270 miles in about 35 mins. This came as a surprise because the TESLA app said it would take 55mins. I'm still new to this whole EV language of kW etc. The Scheels still wasn't open when we left. I've read the other reviewers comments and this would be a different stop at night. I gave this a four star review because though there were lots of chargers and we charged relatively quickly with just two other vehicles parked, there really isn't much around. It seems there's a whole different experience without the Scheels being open. I'm sure that'll change over the next few years."
Just like any supercharger location. I was the only person there. Ran in to get some groceries and the car was fully charged. Everything worked like it should.
"Just like previous post. 4  tesla chargers. 2 others (use adapter). 1 not working. You get about 30mi in a hour. Starbucks, lidi shopping and food places are in the area.ocated on the side of LIDI Shopping in the back corner"
"Just like some other tesla chargers. Nothing much. Far from the gasoline station where you can get some coffee or go to the bathroom. The closest is the grocery store, go inside, turn left and the bathroom is there. That is all I can say. :)"
Just looking for something to get us to the next super chargers and it does the job. ~ 40 miles per hour.
"Just North of 10 & near to a bunch of shops.10 chargers but can't tell which 2 are the 72kw. Waited about 5-10 mins on a Wednesday around 4pm. In lot next to it there's about 20 that will probably be 250kw so faster charging & less wait times in the future.
It's 1st Super charger after Stateline in Ehrenberg, AZ about 100 miles away, so understandably busy. Tesla map had it as having wait times pretty much all day.
Only rocks or shrubs in nearby lot area for dogs to potty.
Subway, Necter Juice & Waba are directly across. In same mini mall is pizza, poke, sushi & waffle spots. Most had outdoor seating. Across the bigger lot is Five Below, Marshalls, Ulta, Burlington etc.
It can get crazy windy so please be mindful of trash...keep it classy Tesla owners :)"
"Just off Interstate 81, in the parking lot of Sheetz. McDonald's, Chick-fil-A, Bojangles, and Burger King within walking distance. Starbucks across the road. Wal-Mart Supercenter nearby."
"Just off of the Penna Turnpike, this is an easy stop for charging and taking a break.  Sheetz does a good job offering a fairly standard, clean and quick experience."
"Just off the 101 and Scottsdale Road, this is the latest Tesla Supercharger in the area. Nineteen stalls providing a 250kW charge will have your Tesla charged quickly.

Plenty of other business in the shopping center. Fast food, sit down dining, shopping, movie theater, bank, even a shooting range.

Rates as of this posting are $0.28 / kWh off peak, and $0.56 / kWh for on peak times.

Located in the north west corner of the intersection of Scottsdale Road and Mayo Boulevard, just south off the 101.

As a side note, in front of G2 Tactical, they have provided free Level 2 charging. A J-1772 to Teala adapter will be required to use on Tesla vehicles."
"Just off the interstate at the Hampton Inn. Friendly staff at the hotel, nice lobby with bathrooms, coffee. 150 kw charger"
Just seen it in the parking lot. Looks nice.
Just stopped to check out the charge rate at the Tesla chargers here and play a little Fallout shelter. 40Amp is OK but not lighting fast.
Just talk with the valet and let them know you're using the charger. It's located inside the valet parking garage on the ground floor (don't take the ramp)
Just the juice I needed
"Just tried charging at 8am, with battery at only 35%. No one else charging, but speed was only about 95 kw/hr. No way were they performing like 250kw chargers. Tried chargers at both ends of the array. Decided to move on to Gothenberg."
"Keep building them up, I have A LOT invested in the EV industry"
"Keeps everyone happy with 16 chargers. Best stop between Dallas and Memphis for sure. Good food, bathrooms, even has a Dennys. The gas station actually has a couple of food places to pick from to eat. We will definitely be making this a spot we stop at from now on."
Kept my vehicle charged...
"Killer destination! 🎶 Review to the theme of Rawhide...

Charging, charging, charging.
Keep those Teslas charging.
Charging till their topped off.
Charge On!

In any kind of weather.
Right here in the heather.
Plug up your Tesla's tater.
Charge On!

Charge them up!
Drive'em out!
Drive'em in!
Charge them out!
Drive on in!
Charge On!"
Kind of a awkward location back behind the Stanley. But you can walk to the hotel for a restroom break. Slower charger 150kw. Nice scenery.
"Kind of an odd, run down place for Superchargers, but happy they are here. Located on the side of the Winn-Dixie. Golf cart parking across from the Superchargers, so watch out for them. Convenient to get food and use the restroom in the Winn-Dixie if they are open. One Supercharger wasn't connecting, so had to switch to another. Smelled like fried chicken when we were here. Just down the street is a Taco Bell, KFC, and Chili's."
"Kind of creepy at night with people hanging around in the back parking lot, watching you. As a previous reviewer mentioned, snow is never cleared properly so it is impossible to even charge in half the spots. It’s a nice new location located behind a Sheetz but they could do a better job of clearing the snow. That plus the weird vibes I’ve gotten on multiple occasions from some people hanging around the back parking area when charging at night makes me give this place a lower rating. Easy on/off highway is a plus."
Kind of difficult to get to but it's a nice setup.
"Kind of in a weird spot, the mall is dead, but it does what it’s supposed to do!"
"Kind of on second level of Biloxi casino parking garage, but only If you drive the wrong way against labelled directional arrows.  Worked fine on a Sunday night at 11 pm when nobody seemed to care, but good luck any other time!   Dedicating one spot to handicapped was quite well thought out as well.  And by ""quite well"", I mean ""not at all.""  It could be worse...it could be Blink, or Chargepoint.  Hahahaha!"
Kind of secluded and older superchargers but they work
Kind of tucked away around the side of a Dunkin’ Donuts.
Kind of weird to find if you're driving through but convenient to shops/food.
"Kinda in middle of nowhere if you are there in off hours . Scheels is right by station but it's operating hour varies. But there is hotel right by where u can use restroom. We got here at 8am.
1 less star is for that. For off hour people passing by would love to have remote restroom."
Lady working front desk iced one spot she prolly should park as far away as possible
"Lake Lawn Lodge! Two chargers. Ours was charging at 48 A, but seems slow (maybe because it’s only 38 degrees?). One of the only Tesla chargers in the area, which seems odd."
"Large blue canoe Big stop next door,clean"
Large charging station in Mall parking lot.  Easy charging.  Ok to visit during the day but I didn't feel safe there at night.
Large gas station with lots of options.  Super clean with 250 watt
Large number of chargers available. Took less than an hour to charge up 310 MI we were down to 30 miles. Clean well-lit area. Meijer shopping and other stores and restaurants.
"Largest available of charging stations seen in Texas, 50 stations… great stop between Dallas and Austin… right at entrance to Buc-ee’s on the north side…"
"Last time i seen that place it was under water ,and you know what they say about oil and water well it goes the same with electricity. It just dont go well together."
Late December 2020 and one out of two was working. Was getting 38 miles per hour in a 2019 AWD DM M3. No complaints here!
"Late night, no amenities but can super charge here quite fast being the only one there."
"Latest update: Supercharger is back up and running.

Note: as of May 27th: I found out this supercharger is temporarily out of service .

The reason ,TESLA is successful, is it’s infrastructure. iPod was not the first digital music player but iTunes is the reason of Apple’s huge success in music market. Fishers is growing city and Tesla recognized it and put a 10 stall brand new urban Supercharger on 3rd level of Switch Garage Parking building. Restrooms and restaurants are close by. Charging speed is impressive , even with multiple car charging at same time, I got 205 miles/hour.
Brixx Pizza ,Another Broken Egg Cafe are close by. Nickel Plate grill and Maya -recommended Mexican restaurant are 5 minutes walk away."
Less star because it was so hard to find there was thin lane between highway and gas station and I missed it and went on highway by mistake and it took 20 more miles for next exit to come back to this supercharger!!! No restroom at least within 2-3 mins distance.
"Less than a mile off I-40. Twelve 250 kWh stalls. The Stuckey’s is a bit nostalgic, and it was nice to find a DQ inside."
"Let me say that, I don't own a Tesla, lol. But, my eight years old son is a bit obsessed with them. So he always asks if we can circle the charging station so he can look at what is plugged in.  There usually is at most, four or rarely five, cars docked. It seems like a good place to have this charging station because it's within walking distance to several restaurants, Academy Sports and Walmart Supercenter."
"Let’s be real, you have to come here during business hours or you’re screwed. NO restrooms, we used a construction porta potty next door. First time In many superchargers in many states I’m unimpressed.

Honestly, even if daylight hours you have a firehouse subs, t mobile, and a Mexican restaurant so ?

One thing was nice, superchargers have light up TESLA signs. Bfd"
"Level 2 / 240V max charger.
Had to wait over an hour to have charger turned on. Owner seemed really disappointed I didn’t have $20 cash and made a sly comment about me taking one of the 10 empty parking spaces for her ‘guests’. Wouldn’t count on this place unless you’re really desperate."
Level 2 blocked off for no reason.
Level 2 charger at the lodge at Geneva on the lake. They have 2 tesla home chargers and 2 universal chargers. My model s got about 26 miles per hour. Located in the front of the parking lot just steps from the hotel entrance!!
"Level 2 charger at the springhill suite, 32v max got about 18m per hour. Not bad if your staying the night. Need J adapter."
Level 2 Charger for guest.
Level 2 charger in a fairly easy to access location with some good and lodging options nearby. Definitely a good location for a stretch of you're driving between Colorado and Utah
Level 2 free
"Level 3 charger working, safe and clean. Located next to a Circle K gas station. Snacks and clean restroom inside for your convenience. Well kept!"
Life saver if your visiting Yellowstone and need an emergency charge. Hidden in back parking lot
Life saver! Stopped to get our car charged on our way back from alpine valley resort. We never would have made it back to Madison in this snowstorm otherwise. We need more charging stations like this nationwide!!
Life saver!!!! At this location
Life saver. CS drive is worry free now for supercharging
"Life-saver. Tesla has limited range in this cold weather around Wisconsin and strangely the charging stations are so few in this city and its suburbs. We searched for charging stations from Wisconsin to Alpine and all other results are small and too informal to rely on. This place is the only one, but also superior compared with any other charging stations (my bad, there aren’t any charging stations but private ports). A huge market is right next to it and there is a quite nice burger place across the street. After the meal our Tesla is charged full from what’s previously 30%. So grateful the this station made our day."
"Light volume, fast charging and well-stocked service station. Clean restrooms"
"Like all Teslas, Super Reliable"
"Like almost all Tesla superchargers, this one is easy to get to, and easy to charge your car. What you really want to know is that there is a Big Y grocery store just across the parking lot, and the bathrooms are very close to the entrance. Easy to charge. Easy to shop. Easy to pee."
Like any super charger but the sheet gas station always has clean bathrooms and fresh hot food and coffee.
Like it
Like it. Faster destination charger.
"Like many other Tesla superchargers that are stationed near Meijer this one is well done.  The superchargers are located near the Southeast side of the parking area, close to the store.  But not too close that they will get much use outside of the heavy holidays.

May'22 update. There is now an Electrify America charger set next to the Tesla ones.  4 of each plug type."
"Like others have said, it is very slow: 8-12 miles per hour. And there is only one charger. I came from San Antonio to pay my respects to the Robb Elementary victims, the same day Pres. Biden visited. Being an unusually very busy weekend, it was likely if you came, the station was already in use and you would have waited a long time. I got lucky when I arrived; the one car charging was just leaving. But passing by later in the day, I saw two cars: one charging the other waiting.

It would be nice if someone can find a non-Tesla charger nearby that might give 30+ miles per hour and post it here."
Like that it’s near a place you can grocery shop while you charge only thing I didn’t care for was random people asking for a ride it honestly scared my kids a bit. I know it can’t be controlled but that’s the type of area it’s in. I couldn’t understand the man to save my life but I had my two kids in the car and this guy was asking me for a ride was a little off putting to say the least.
"Like the quick charge, but there are few spots and they allow general parking in them, so you may roll up with 5% battery left and somebody in a Hyundai decided the other 200 spots weren't good enough, had to park in one of 8 Tesla spots... Positive bonus: it's near the Maple Cafe, which is quite tasty, but only open lunch and breakfast, so travel early lol...🤷‍♀️🙈😂😘✌"
"Lima -OH location it’s right off of I-75 first time we charged last week we did not get charged and on our way back it did the same, not complaining but it’s in convenient location and very clean around nice picnic table to sit and walk around!"
"Limited choice of services right nearby, but the beautiful rail trail that crosses the Connecticut river  a few minutes stroll to the west has access right across the street."
Limited dining choices and no green space for pets.  But there is a nice grocery store and other strip mall businesses close by.
"Liquid-cooled Version 3 superchargers. Initial charge 1,000Kph!
Good restaurants opposite."
"Listed as 120kw but is actually V3 250kw, excellent charger works perfect!"
"Listed as a 250 kW charger, the fastest I've seen is 75kW."
Listed at 250w. We only got a max of 68kw
"Listen, I'm not mad at this Tesla Supercharger. I'm just disappointed. I think this electric vehicle charging station gets an undeserved reputation because of the company it keeps. A Wawa? A KFC/Taco Bell? Most of the other Tesla Supercharger stations are far more successful, living on their own, starting families and making other little electric vehicle charging stations.

I am giving this Tesla Supercharger three stars because it can only go as far as its dreams allow. There is still so much time to grow and improve. Don't give up on this Tesla Supercharger. It won't give up on you."
"Little over a mile off I-81, no waiting for charger but not a solar panel in sight of charger so not sure where electricity was coming from."
"Live nearby so it's a really convenient spot for us to charge. Too bad they're level 2 but got 1 year free charging so definitely going to take full advantage of that! Can be packed during peak hours, best times are later at night. Right next to the freeway, Whole Foods and a tons of restaurants nearby to kill some time"
"LL2 for sure. When you see the demo cars take a right and go down one more level.

This was tricky to find but they are here."
Local circus going on their..great show
Located  at the Beautiful Brasstown Valley Resort and Spa. Come by and charge your Tesla . While your there the restaurant is off the chain great cooks and service not to be believed.  Great place to kick back and enjoy life....
"Located 2 miles from the I40 exit for Cookeville, this northern Tennessee Supercharging station is one of the nicest I’ve seen so far.
The supercharger is conveniently located to many restaurants, drugstore and a nice grocery store."
"Located along Highway 95 between Las Vegas and Reno.  The chargers are located in front of the Tonopah Volunteer Fire Department, across the street from Valero & Pace Gas Stations.  The charging area is very nice, clean with a cover eating area.  Limited options for Snacks and Food near the chargers, Public restrooms are not available.  Good area for letting the Dogs stretch their Paws."
"Located along Highway 95 between Las Vegas and Reno.  The chargers are located in the parking lot of the Golden Gate Truck stop, Public Restrooms are located inside the convenience store at the Truck Stop. Very limited food options within walking distance.  Not a great area for Dogs to stretch their Paws, dirt and pavement.  Plus side...the area was clean."
"Located along the southwestern side of the Buc-ee's parking lot. If exiting southbound I-95, keep right at the exit ramp and the far right lane feeds straight into the Buc-ee's parking lot. Once in the lot take the first right so that you’re driving along the outer row of the parking lot. The Supercharger stalls will be on your right.  For those exiting off northbound I-95, after you turn left onto N Williston Rd and travel over the bridge you'll have to go to the stop light intersection to bear right into the parking lot. One in the lot turn right again to head toward superchargers.

Buc-ee's has a variety of beverages, snacks, and freshly made food to choose from. Bathrooms are excellent.  Just browsing the 50K square foot interior will keep you occupied the entirety of your charge."
"located at a Chevron station with nice bathrooms and a clean convenience store.

"Located at a cute little town, right next to couple of restaurants. charging was super fast, it was done before we finished our meal. Not crowded at all. 0.47/kw."
"Located at a Hy-Vee, in the back of the lot. Hy-vee has food options and clean bathrooms."
"Located at a HyVee ""Gas Station"" (that saying won't age well) and has V3 charging speeds 773mi/hr! So be sure to ""Precondition"" your batteries before you get here to take full advantage of the V3 speeds! Major thank you to HyVee for being such a big supporter of EVs!"
"Located at a Sheetz, next to a mall. Very convenient. Locals tend to abuse the 10 min general parking in the charging bays with their gas vehicles, but otherwise a good charging stop."
Located at a Welcome center. Shop inside as well as clean restrooms. Close to a gas station. Hotels and cracker barrell at walking distance.
Located at a Woodman's. If you've never been to one you'll be amazed at how large they are and all the food they have available. Bathrooms are clean and you can get food for your road trip here. Chargers are 120kW and charge quickly.

Located at Casey's You can charge your car to the left of the parking lot but this Casey's has great employees even though the store is running a bit behind

"Located at level 3b of the south garage at atlas. Can be viewed ahead and to the left upon entry at the south deck. Has 10 stalls and I can confirm that they charge at 70kW. Must pay for parking, but the rates are reasonable. Overall, a great addition for the charging needs of NYCers."
Located at P1 parking area L (orange zone)
"Located at Sheetz, has everything you need. Clean toilets, food, plenty of room to walk around. It is a busy traffic area and it did not look like you could walk to any restaurants near by.

Chargers were well maintained."
"Located at the back of Sheetz gas station. Great place to stop for a quick charge. In a nice, safe location for a female traveler. Right off of interstate 40. It is only 150kW, but beggers can't be choosers 🤣  I prefer to stop at the 250kW places."
"Located at the entrance to a Meijer store. Nothing really within walking distance except the Meijer.

Used on 6/27/2022 about 6:30pm.  Arrived with 1 of 8 chargers in use and one marked off with yellow tape (broken). Charged our M3 long range from 31% to 63% in 10 minutes."
"Located at the far end of Litchfield. Had to do a few minutes of driving to find them. But, 2 Tesla Wall Connectors and 1 EV style charger available. Currently charging at 38 mph in my AWD Model 3"
"Located at the gas station, very under utilized spot and at the time was only $0.33 per kWh.

Bathrooms are clean and there is food nearby if you wanted to grab it before starting a charge. Wouldn’t recommend trying to walk as the roads are busy and people don’t pay attention around here"
Located at the Hampton Inn.
"Located at the rear east corner of the Meijer parking lot. Garbage and recycling bins are onsite for use. Plenty of food/drink/bathroom locations within walking distance (Culver’s, gas station, Arby’s, and meijer)"
"Located at the Sales and Service Center, this location tends to be busy but always have Supercharger access an rarely has any of the stalls out of order.

Located at the Sheetz station. Very close to James Madison University.
"Located behind a movie theater, but walkable to shops and restaurants. Also a nice outdoor areas in the middle of the marketplace to lounge out."
Located behind Casey’s General Store right off the highway. Love the pizzas they serve. The best thing about this place…V3! Wish they were all like this!
"Located beside the Dunkin Donuts, just after the Tilton Diner. It's a ways back off the road."
"Located by H&M and Hooters.
Great stop but at least 4 cables laying on the ground - indicating not functional 🤷‍♂️"
Located conveniently near food courts and costco. Perfect for a quick charge before heading out of town
Located conveniently off of I10. Able to drive direct from Birmingham AL in MS refresh long range. Plenty of food places nearby.
Located in a Culver's Parking lot. Not much else around though. Great for a quick stop.
Located in a HyVee parking lot less than a mile from the Mississippi River.
"Located in a HyVee parking lot not too far from the highway. It's a V3 Supercharger (250 kW) charging speed. Be sure to start preconditioning your battery early! If it’s not charging fast, then you haven’t driven your car for 3 hours to get here.

Thanks HyVee for being such a big supporter of EVs!"
Located in a nicely populated shopping plaza. Walking distance from Starbucks and Moe's. The only negative is that two charging stations were not working. 200/ mi/ hr charging speed.
"Located in a parking garage, which is free for the 1st hour. The downtown area is nice to walk around. Subway in the building and bathrooms by the train station. Lots of cute shops, restaurants and a children's museum around the area."
Located in a shopping mall parking lot. Plenty of charging spots and easy access to fast food.
"Located in a very large shopping area with P.F. Chang’s, Carrabba‘s and other restaurants. There’s also a Costco, bass pro shop, target as well."

Arrived over 30%, maxed out at around 140kW."
Located in parking lot of target. Tire one/ Valvoline oil change will be in front of you hall mark cards to your left. Best buy to your right
"Located in the parking for a Marriot Courtyard with a Starbucks, Wendy's, and Captain D's within walking.  A little tricky to get to owing to having to cross the river and then hit the correct one way street.

We used on 6/23/2022 about 1:30pm.  There were 5 of 8 chargers in use when we showed up.  Charging was slow, about 1/2 what we hoped the 150KW units would provide. Charged our M3 long range from 31% to 71% in 25 minutes.

Used again on return trip of 6/27/2022. Arrived about 4pm with 0 of 8 chargers in use. Charged our M3LR from 41% to 85% in 21 minutes."
"Located in the parking lot behind the Oakhurst Inn on the right hand side. This charger is conveniently located in town, though as many reviewers have noted the charging speed is not sustained as soon as more Teslas are charging. Despite that, it's a clean, safe location."
"Located in the parking lot of Daiso, great location, clean, and feels very safe. Next to a Boba tea Cafe and an AMC movie theater."
"Located in the parking lot of Fred Meyer Grocery store; north side of the parking lot. Typical charging station, well lit and clean.  There are plenty of snack and food options in the immediate area.  Public Restrooms are available inside Fred Meyers during business hours.  Decent area to walk dogs, mostly pavement."
"Located in the parking lot of the Holiday Market.  Restrooms are available inside Holiday Market during business hours.  Also good options for snacks and a Deli.  Decent areas to walk the Dogs, mostly dirt and open fields.  I was traveling from Reno to Medford Oregon. I stopped in Susanville CA for charging and left with 90% with my next stop at Klamath Falls with over 20% charge estimated.  About half way between Susanville and Klamath Falls my estimated charge level to my destination dropped to less than 5%. Thankfully I was able to detour to Alturas charging station to get the extra charge needed to make it to Klamath Falls."
Located in the parking lot of the new Fairfield Inn. Nice location right off interstate 65 but not many restaurants within walking distance. There's a picnic table and outdoor seating near the chargers if you want to bring your own food!
Located in the parking lot of the Route 66 Museum.  Good location with Public Bathrooms located inside the Museum during operating hours 9:00Am - 4:00PM.  Plenty of places to grab a snack such as Mr D'z Route 66 Diner.  There is also a Public Park located across the street for those traveling with pets that need to stretch their Paws.
"Located in the Sheridan underground parking. If you have a Tesla ask the front desk or parking attendant if you can access the garage for a charge, they are typically very nice about it. They also have one J-1772 for other electric cars."
Located in the south (back) side of the hotel.
Located in the Trader Joe’s underground parking on the lowest level. Hard to find with no signs.
Located in the valet parking section behind the storage containers. This is not as fast as other chargers in the area with only 32 Amp and 20 mo/hr charge rate.  I was not staying at the hotel and but they still let me charge. I went inside and bought some coffee at the coffee shop that serves Starbucks coffee.
Located just off interstate 55 at a Phillips 66 gas and convenience store. Clean restrooms with baby changing station. Hot food choices with inside seating. All the candy and snack items. Very clean and comfortable. 30 min to 88% and I’m off!
Located near Turtle bay park
Located next to check in. There’s four 8kw chargers here. Arrived on Friday night with ~5 miles left. Charged overnight to ~150 miles.
Located next to the casino with average restaurants nearby. Saw a cool Tesla though!
"Located off Exit 79 of I-95. Supercharger are on the southwest side of the Hampton Inn parking lot. The location is about 2 miles from the I-95 and I-40 interchange. After charging, when approaching the first stop light intersection (S Walton and 50/242) you’ll want to be in the left left turn lane so that you’ll be ready for the left turn onto the on-ramp for southbound I-95 after crossing over bridge. If you’ll be continuing north on I-95 or either direction on I-40 you’ll want to head through the intersection since S Walton Dr feeds directly into the on-ramp for northbound I-95."
"Located off of I-35 in San Marcos Premium Outlets, but realize that mall traffic can be congested. Closest entrance is Centerpoint Road. It's on the east side of the mall, that is, the back parking lot. There are nearby EVgo chargers.

You can find just about anything in the mall by walking, and dodging traffic at popular shopping times."
Located on gas station property. Multiple restaurants and fast food area. Very clean restrooms and a perfect spot to stop and charge up. Plenty of charging stations and wasn’t overly occupied while I stopped here. It’s located outside of city and right off the exit so area wasn’t super packed which made it a quick and easy stop.
"Located on one of the corner of the AMC Theatre, inside a mall. Mostly empty and have lots of stores to visit while the car is charging."
Located on south side of hotel. There is a path from the north parking lot that goes to Olive Garden. Otherwise lobby is very nice and bar opens at 5pm.
"Located on the 3rd floor of the parking garage, no valet required, however, if this charger is in use you can ask the hotel front desk if they can park and charge it in valet, and there are 2 more plugs, there. They are awesome at the front desk."
"Located on the basement floor.
Two stations are out of service. While you are charging your car can shop at Trader Joe's but the Tesla mobile app connection is weak so you can't only relay the charging time on the app."
Located on the northeast side of the parking lot at Meijer. Plenty of spots and charges faster than some other super charging locations. Always appreciate Meijer’s investment in these stations.
Located on the second floor of the garage. The current max charge is 72kw and only 6 of the 8 were operational. Located next to Harris Teeter.
"Located on the side of Hampton Inn hotel.  A couple of charging stations.  However, be aware, you must be a guest to use the chargers.  They don't allow anyone else to come in and even pay for the time.  Guests only."
"Located on the side of the H&S / PM “Alien Ship” market! This is  like the best features of The Simpson’s Kwik-E-Mart with alcohol, fast heated foods, junk foods & beverages & bathrooms. I wish they had a decent espresso machine but that’s ok, the fun alien art makes it worth a visit!"
"Located on the side parking lot of Marshalls in a well lit place.  There were plenty of shops around if you didn't feel like waiting in the car. Due to the number of homeless people around, this part of Emeryville can be a little sketchy. But I did see the police patrolling the area."
"Located right beside Carowinds entrance, Infront of Comfort Inn at exit 90 with 12 level III 250kW charging stations, Clean and convenient!!!"
"Located to the right of the Dunkin Donuts, fastest supercharger in the area.  Charged by 2016 MS @ 505 mph!  Not all the chargers were operational in early Sept 2020."
Located within the Wawa parking lot. Easy access from the road. A little slower than the said 250KW. We used this at night before we checked in at our hotel which was only 1.6 miles away. Fairly safe and well lit. The Wawa has bathrooms and a quick bite to eat if needed.
Located within walking distance of a Chick-Fil-A & Starbucks. If headed to Chick-Fil-A bear right on the sidewalk and cross in front of the drive-thru. Enter in the main door. The side door that you think you would use is blocked because they’re using that area for storage.
"Located within walking distance of Whole Foods-Gateway, REI, several eateries."
Location at Winchester rt 7 Sheetz. Wasn't being used when I stopped. Looks like all chargers are in good shape.
"Location easy to get to, shopping in the area (Staples, Old Navy, Kohl’s, Ulta, Pier 1 Imports, Pedro, Bed Bath and Beyond, TJ Max, Walmart and Ross). 8 charging stations. Never once did I ever run into another Tesla charging. It says it is 150 kw max, but charger is slow!   Max my car has ever reached was 43kw (177 mi/hr), even being the only one here. I’ve jumped stalls thinking it may just be one charger, but they’re all equally slow. Gets the job done, but with more time!"
Location filled with demo vehicles. No where to charge. Needs to be removed off charging locations. Very inconvenient.
"Location for supercharger isn't ideal. There isn't much to do while charging the car. The chargers are fast, though."
"Location good.
Needs more of these locations in OHIO."
Location is amazing but the charging speeds never get close to the advertised capability. Other charging stations like the Jersey Gardens one are lightening fast compared to this one.
"Location is cool but this is by far the slowest station I've been to, it's the most common one I have to visit because of the distance but I've been a lot of places traveling and even like a year ago wasn't as slow. Not sure what changed but sometimes the car can say over an hour depending how busy and how much battery. But even without crowded chargers still takes longer than most other SC"
"Location is currently fully packed with 12 Teslas charging. Its 8pm on Saturday. Currently have low battery (less than 20%) and charging at 37kW (124mi/hr). It's at a decent location, but I do not want to stay here an hour to be able to get home. Planning to stay 10min to push along to McDonough."
"Location is good, right off the highway. It was clean and wasn’t busy but I could see you having to wait since bays are only up to 150kw and not that many. I would recommend the other location by the route 66 museum if you have enough charge to drive there."
"Location is great.  Not too far from the route one exit and it’s right behind Wawa and walking distance to Starbucks, So it’s a great place to grab a quick bite."
"Location is high volume and desperately needs an upgrade. Peak usage time can be up to an hour wait. Neighboring hotel is no longer friendly to EV owners by installing locks on restroom doors and turning people away. Suggest taking the alternate route through the Supercharger in Alice, if possible."
Location is in hotel parking lot. Nice and clean with restrooms available inside the hotel. Staff was very friendly. Some parkings were reserved exclusively for charging and a few was for charging and ICE cars.
"Location is near the freeway, and has several restaurants, a Kwik Trip, and a Festival Foods grocery store within walking distance."
"Location would be better behind the building as often there are stalls blocked. I know there is a 15 minute General parking, but I've seen employees come to work and park there. Bathroom and food makes this a great stop, V3 upgrade and relocation of chargers would make this 5 stars"

"Locations is convenient and well lit, easy access from Garden State Parkway. Grocery is shopping available across the parking lot."
Locked with padlock. Have to pay at hotel front desk for access and then wait for them to go unlock the breaker to turn on power to it. Would rather use chargepoint-like system and pay via app.
Lodge is currently closed with the entry gates locked so no way to get to the charger
look for a charger for your tesla here you will find it for 60 minutes you can charge it and continue your journey from home to the tesla charger in my direction it is the closest while I put one at home this seems fine to me on Fridays it is always full good at the time I have gone 🥴.  There are stores where you can go shopping while your Tesla is charging and the security in it Place is good and accessible and a large parking lot so you can take your time away from home
Look for the Target sign. The supercharger is right underneath.
Looked clean and was nice quick stop for a charge and some snacks during the day. Drove by at night and needs more lighting to feel more secure. We’re plenty of open spaces and the dog park was open.
"Looked solid dece

Nobody at them at all. One pickup awkwardly wedged to the side of one to avoid both encroaching on the charging area and being associated with undicking up the earth"
"Looking for the charger? Just go to the Texas Steakhouse and you'll be fine. These are older, slower chargers (150kW) so they take a little longer to charge your ride up, but that gives you time to actually sit down to a meal or shop without hitting the idle fee. There's a Hobby Lobby across the parking lot (with clean bathrooms) and the Texas Steakhouse has 20% off for Tesla drivers (though I will always prefer Texas Roadhouse instead). My current favorite option is to get something tasty at the Smithfield Chicken and Barbeque accross the street (large restaurant, also clean bathrooms). The road is busy though so you may want to drive there first, pick up a togo box and bring it to the charger.  That side of the street also has a Gamestop and a Panera."
Looks like they have updated to the newer style of supercharger recently. Solar powered and also right next to the substation.
Looks nice but beware you must go during business hours and pay in the lobby for a ticket or make a donation
Looks nice but I don't have an EV yet
"Looks relatively new.  Very fast charge, was the only one charging. At a Stewart's, across from McDs.   Great!"
"Looks to be a brand new 250kW station right next to Holiday Inn and Walmart. Within walkable distance to many restaurants and shopping while you wait. Note, there is another supercharger right around the corner from this one in a gas station parking lot, that's a 150kW station, don't be fooled when you get off the interstate by it, my nav automatically routed me to this 250kW station."
"Lot of spots and completely empty. Food and shopping nearby. Also if your heading there from so cal don't follow the Tesla navigation to get off the freeway early and go through town, much slower than the freeway exit just past the chargers."
Lots of activity here - many non-EV trucks/cars park here for longer than the 15 min general parking.  Never got above 110kW with just 2 of us charging 4 spaces apart.
"Lots of actual food options, unlike most stations with only fast food. There’s also a nice outdoor seating area."
"Lots of availability, easy walk to Target."
Lots of broke glass and trash around the charging stations. Not desirable for dog walking. Watch your step!   DQ bathroom was not clean.  The third charger we tried did work.
Lots of businesses around to choose where to stretch your legs at. Right in front of 24 hr Woodmans. It is a little bit hidden inside the parking lot but fast charging so no complaints.
Lots of chargers and fast charging too! Approximately 374 miles per hour (battery not heated for optimal charging).
Lots of chargers and lots of space. Go inside and get a great barbecue sandwich while you're waiting.
Lots of chargers and nice being at a Wawa. Can grab some food while I wait. Keep in mind there are chargers on both sides of the building. The west side is always packed and east side is always thin.
Lots of chargers and right next to a gas station for rest room breaks and snacks. The bathroom was clean and well kept
Lots of chargers at a sheetz with a McDonald’s right next to it. Pretty great stop. No problems
"Lots of chargers next to Macy’s at a mall. We were the only ones there at 10 AM on a Saturday and went from 15 to 100% in about 45 minutes. The mall opens at 10am so it was easy to kill time there. Note there are not breakfast options in the food court although it’s open. After we left we learned there was a Starbucks somewhere in the mall- but we didn’t see it when we were in there.

Of note- there is a family lounge in the food court with comfortable chairs, couches, and children play area and toys - great for breastfeeding as someone who has done so in an open area food court at chargers prior.

4 stars because because I’d rather have a charger at a normal rest stop where everything is close together and malls are just a sad vibe"
"Lots of chargers, completely empty on a Friday at noon.  At Home and Costco right there.  Large parking lot for all the stores, including lots of restaurants.  Easy on/off from I-75."
"Lots of chargers, couple of solid food options nearby, and clean Tesla bathrooms in the service center."
"Lots of chargers, very few cars. I was in and out. It's very close to a large shopping center."
Lots of chargers! Next to target and many other stores.
Lots of chargers. Clean and convenient  location near Oniel Cinemas and the Emerson Urgent care.
"Lots of chargers. Ray's has restrooms and good quality chocolate! There's also a Radio Shack franchise store here (John's Satellite), and just outside the shopping center is a Starbucks."
Lots of chargers. Speed was about 400mi/hr on a Saturday morning. Lots of great shopping. No public restrooms or quick stop shops.
"Lots of charging ports and v3 250 kW, so nice and fast.

We have a model 3, but were in Atlanta and rented a Model Y from Hertz. They wanted it returned with at least 70%. This supercharger was 6% away from the rental return."
Lots of charging stations and a Buc-ee's. What else do you need!
Lots of charging stations. Location is well lit.
"Lots of decently fast superchargers, but not very convenient location if traveling from DC to CT. Confirm other poster comment about Tesla GPS dumping you in middle of intersection. Go left at that intersection; chargers are at Deptford Mall in Boscov’s parking lot. Grassy area at chargers for dogs. No good food options but great if you need underwear or a new pair of pants!"
"Lots of fast chargers, the Cedar Band Travel Plaza is right here and has lots of good snack choices, including Oreo Cow Tales. Plaza also has the good long wooden windshield cleaners that work good for bug scrubbing."
Lots of food and shopping nearby. Easy to find.
"Lots of food and stores nearby but poor placement and stopped our charge at 72% (we’re capped at 95% for our road-trip). It’s in the middle of a parking lot row at a mall bringing you closer to the mall doors/bathroom. The closest bathroom was okay. 4-5 stalls and one was out of order. Poorly maintained and dirty, no paper towels, light out above baby changing station. Both men and women’s restrooms had baby changing stations. The most annoying feature of this location is the poorly planned parking lot/road ways around the mall. It’s like a trap and difficult to get around, especially if you need to get a quick bite to eat nearby then leave. Would skip for a different Supercharger if we’re passing through again."
Lots of food choice nearby… BWW nearby.
Lots of food options and plenty of chargers. Located in the Big Y parking lot.
"Lots of food options around, not usually busy for charging"
Lots of good spots to within a couple minutes walk or drive.
Lots of new very fast chargers in a convenient location.
"Lots of open pedestals at V3 charger located at the Kingman visitor center with exhibits of historic Route 66, gift shops, rest rooms and air conditioning! Great facility to be adjacent to a supercharger!"
"Lots of open slots and a very nice spacious Dunkin Donuts with clean restrooms. There's also a Shell gas station close by with a store if you want to buy snacks and drinks, etc."
"Lots of options around to stretch your legs. Would recommend a look in the souvenir shop and if you want a spirited walk, get a caffeinated beverage across and up the street at Ahimsa Coffee, well worth the trip either while you are waiting for the charge or right after (because it is a very spirited walk)."
"Lots of options in walking distance to make the charging time go by. From a restaurant, The Oasis Southwest Grill, to a Pilot and the usual gas station. If it's late and you're tired, you can get a room at the Hampton Inn or Days Inn for the night. Didn't use any restrooms so I can't provide any info about those, but I'm sure there are many options also. All right off the highway with about 8 charging bays, you'll be able to see it as you exit. Getting to the  chargers is a bit tricky but if you zig then just zag again and you'll find them."
"Lots of parking space. Can move your car if fully charged conveniently.
Lots of walkable options for restroom, shopping, food and snacks.

Walkable to Buffalo Wild wings which was open until midnight.

Target is close enough too."
Lots of room for the dogs to run.
Lots of shops close to walk to while Tesla charges. Two birds one stone kinda thing. Lol
"Lots of slots, not busy, easy access from the highway.
Service plaza has toilets, fast-food and convenience store."
"Lots of space if you need to drop a trailer before charging. There during the day, but not certain I would wast to charge there late at night."
"Lots of spots right by the food court entrance of the mall..... however, spots do get ICEd. Great stop if you have small kids,  food court has a chick-fil-a and a play area.... just keep in mind when the mall closes, and that busy times may have limited food court seating and ICE-free charging spots"
"Lots of stalls and looks like more new ones soon. Barely anyone here on a Tuesday evening. Lots of space to let dogs out while you wait or explore the cute hotel that hosts these chargers.

Got 217kw under 20%"
Lots of stalls and mostly open when I used. Only got 250kw for around 5 minutes when I entered with a preconditioned battery but it was only 45 degrees out.
Lots of stalls and next to a Mcdonalds
"Lots of stalls, fast, got 150kW. Food options limited. Check out the new ""off the 46"" Mexican restaurant if you're avoiding fast food chains."
"Lots of stalls. Super low prices if charging in the morning. .17 cents kWh is what I paid this morning. On a major highway with access to turnpike and route 1.
Says 250 kw but I was only getting around 150 kw. Was on 40% though."
Lots of stations and a very handy midsized grocery store next to it.
Lots of stores around close to the freeway. Good spot
Lots of stuff nearby. Windshield clwaning station is a great bonus.
Lots of superchargers well located. Bathrooms in the museum in front. Or a Porta potty.
Lots of Tesla charging stations and close to hotels and restaurants.
Lots to do around this supercharger. No cost to enter garage
Love Buc-ee's. Best place to charge between Dallas and Houston. All money saved on gas goes towards beaver nuggets and hot sauces.
Love charging at Wawa. Great coffee and snacks
Love charging here. This place is on my way home and has tons of cool places to eat. I love charging here because it’s safe and efficient. Really close to the highway too. My favorite Tesla charging station for sure
Love going to these chargers! They are fast and there are multiple available. The area isn’t extremely safe or clean but restrooms are decent. Stop here atleast once a month at the minimum and have never had issues. There is a lot of trash in the grass areas so not ideal for a dog who grabs and eats everything. No designated dog area but there is grass for them to use the restroom if needed.
"Love how close this place is off the I-5. However, as of March 2023, several chargers don’t work! Had to move my car several times to find one that worked. I know the one at the end was working."
Love it
Love it
"Love it here! Nice and quiet. Plus, you gotta check out the hotel, very cool interior design. Reminds me of Vegas. 😉"
"Love it, great location to stop with plenty of snacks and restrooms. Now Tesla just needs to convert it to a 250kw, like all the others"
Love it!
Love Sheetz Superchargers. Very convenient!
Love tesla
"Love that it says reserved, no ICE cars hogging the spot 👏"
Love that there is a HyVee right here that’s open 6 days a week until 11pm. Great fast food options during the day inside.
Love that we bringing big tech to town
"Love the convenience station with squeegee, hand sanitizer, and gloves. Circle K has many good snack and drink options with a smart self checkout. Fancy!"
"Love the convenient location and its free. But, 3 were inoperable, and 3 were only 5 kW. I previously have charged here at 10 kW."
Love the fast supercharging here (500+ miles/hour) and you can't beat the coffee and smoothies at Jolts & Juice.  Favorite stop on the Portland-to-Boise run.
"Love the Lee, MA. Supercharger.  Eight new, fast chargers, including my favorite, the nose-first stall 1.
Went to Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival this month.  The Lee SC was perfectly located between our hotel, the venue, local restaurants and shopping and just yards from the I-90 interchange.
It's in the parking lot for the Big Y supermarket.  I got fresh, nutritious snacks to eat for my brief charging stops and stocked up on food for the drive back to Philly. Great store.
So take your Tesla to the Berkshires and enjoy this beautiful part of the U.S. with the convenience of easy charging.  There are multiple SCs on the primary routes from NY, NJ, MA. (August, 2017)"
"Love the location and the Wawa, but 1A was super slow, 46 kw, with a couple of other cars charging. Edit, sped up to 99kw with just me charging, still pretty slow but getting better. Had to use this one because of a bike rack. For anyone not from here, this area is amazing. Many great dining and retail options across the busy street."
"Love the location of the charging station. Very close to some good restaurants and shops and is just right off the highway ramp. Charging is also very fast too, we were able to get 100 miles of charge in just 20 minutes and we got to our destination on time."
Love the location. It's right next to Target that has Starbucks and CVS inside. Very convenient.
"Love the Meijer SC locations. Perfect for shopping, or even grab n go food, or snacks. 👍"
Love the new locations at WAWA. GREAT COFFEE ☕️
Love the retro Dennys next door
Love the Tesla Supercharger. 150 miles in 30 minutes of charge for $15
Love the Wawa superchargers. Wednesday 3 pm. No other cars here. Started out fast at 150wH but then slowed down to 70-75. Watched a show in Netflix while we waited to get to 80%.  Maybe we weren’t preconditioned enough.
Love these pull-thru locations and this one is at a McDonald's so it a great meal stop when traveling.
"Love these, now open to others! Booooooooo!"
"Love this location because there is a large number of charger bays and it usually has room for You or someone else will be wrapping up. The area is super sketchy aka tweakers, junkies, etc.  that’s everywhere though. Keep your head held high, mind your business, and you will be golden. I usually go eat at a local restaurant or go into Target 🎯 (see my analysis on the dope fiends!) 💯🙏🏽"
"Love this location. Close to home for a quick charge when battery is low.  100 kWh peak for a model 3 SR. 93 miles cost $4.09. It's great that Meijer is close as well as Deets BBQ, Steak Escape, Tropical Smoothie, Sakura Express and Chipotle and Tony Packos is a short walk away.  Seems to be friendly Tesla owners tol chat with as well."
Love this spot! Nice little creek area to look at. Can’t really explore in there because of the lushness of it all and litter but better than always staring at the concrete jungle! Outlet mall is right here to walk around as well! This is great!
"Love this spot! Plug in, go to Miguel Jr’s and eat dinner or go shop at Target. There’s plenty to do while charging here. Great location. Lots of people around and very well lit. Safe place to charge."
"Love this store but hate the new digital policy's.  I have to have a card, I have to get the digital coupons...blah,blah,blah. What happened to sales for customers and customer service.  I hate jumping through your hoops just to get my groceries."
Love this supercharger facility. So many pull in spots to charge and very spacious. Worked out perfectly when I’m towing my RV…
"Love this supercharger. Looks like it was brand new, clean and right next to a huge grocery store. Really nice clean bathrooms too."
Love WaWa gestations. Easy & convenient if you have a Tesla like myself or any electrical vehicle. Highly recommend prices are ten times better than a regular gas type. So make your switch
Loved it. Jumba Juice and Starbucks just cross the charging station
Loved the location and museum. Chargers are fast  (250kw) and there’s plenty of them. It is a bit off the highway but still better than the other location in Kingman
Loved the location of a mall parking lot for a different “stop and shop” experience.  Chargers had some graffiti stickers on them and it was a bit trickier to navigate in and out due to mall traffic however appreciated the surrounding amenities.
Loved this location. The pit stop was good was the service station here maintained much better than the many others. The charging location was not crowded and let us charge the quick and continue the trip.
Lovely location and very convenient
"Lovely SC with 150kw max. It's a V2 charger with nicely located stalls, and some great amenities nearby. Take a stroll while you wait."
Loving these new V3 super chargers. Every spot was full but everyone was still getting Max power to get back on the road again. The little fueling station also has a pretty good selection of food and drinks
"Low price, quick charge, plenty parking. Great!"
"Low traffic, cheap charging rates, 12 chargers, built next to a grocery store = perfect charging stop for a road trip"
Low wattage chargers. But often the chargers don’t work
Macadoodle's liquor store is amazing. Good place to find unique refreshments while you charge.
Mach 1.4... I was back on the road in 15 minutes with a 65% charge.
Made a quick stop here yesterday for about ten minutes.Arrived here Wednesday at around noon. Plenty of stalls available. Not too busy. Saw two other Teslas in and out for a quick charge as well. Good amenities around. Chick-Fil-A around the corner.
"Made it from here to Santa Fe SC w/ 7% remaining.  Had 1 passenger & it was 5 degrees out.  Not going to lie...could not afford the “luxury” of heat the entire way, but we made it.  There is a destination charger @ the Four Seasons in Tesuque if needed."
"Made plans to meet friends for a meal at the Pfister Hotel with an expectation to get enough charge at the destination charger to make it home without stopping at a supercharger. One slot had a tesla charging, but the others had non-EV's parked in stalls that were posted for EV charging only.  They were still there a couple of hours later when I left.  They parking garage clearly does not enforce the EV only rules.  Anyway, I won't expect charger availability if I go back there."
"Made some friends while charging, walked right up to the car and lightly honked a few times (probably waiting for food).  They eventually got bored and goose-walked away.

Charger worked great though, our first supercharging experience with our new 3.  This was around 10:30AM on Saturday 3/23."
Main chargers were down but they brought in two temporary super chargers that work! Thank goodness since these are the only superchargers nearby
"Make sure to back up your tesla close, the range isn't far for the charge cable, and they're positioned like right behind the car, not like next to it. But they charged just fine."
Make sure you go to this one and not the Destination charger.  We wasted an hour because the car did not find the real supercharger during multiple searches of the area.   then i found it on Waze and got ourselves situated in an actual supercharger
"Make this your go to Supercharger.
WaWa (gas station) super clean plus lots of food options in walking distance."
"Mall amenities are great when open. No indoor bathroom close, but 3 porta potties not far, by JC Penny garage."
"Man!!! This place doesn’t exist on Apple Maps. I’m not sure how long it’s been here but it’s a saving grace for me.
Place more Tesla chargers between Dallas Texas to Tulsa please!!!"
Managed to get 247kw charging on my model 3. But tapered off almost immediately after that
"Mannnnnnnn, I just left a review on Tesla official app notification that I loved this charger stop and it was “smooth sailing”…. Until I just looked down and realized they changed the prices here today to tht wack peak pricing I see at other chargers.. it just went from .20 cents / kW, to now .37 cents / kW !! That’s almost double!!! And from 10pm - 10am they do .26 cents al/ kW now. Just wack they raised the prices here! idk why I would think they would keep the price low when all other chargers do this peak pricing stuff, but I thought we had our little home gem. 2 thumbs down for this!!!"
Many chargers with no users at the time we were there. Nothing better than that. Convenience store and across the street a specialty food store and a BBQ pit (which wasn't open). The Good Food store makes sandwiches and has premade items to go plus wine and other goodies. Recommended.
"Many chargers, a little down from other chargers that were close. These ones are faster and nicer part of town. During regular hours, bathrooms inside Route 66 but don’t know on off hours."
Many empty place and many fast food available around
"Many lightening FAST superchargers at this dealer/service center. Great location off I-80, although have to walk a ways to get to amenities in the large nearby strip mall (Target, Panera and other chain eateries) when Tesla facility is closed. Could be a drag in 100+ heat; luckily only 77F when we were there at night."
"Many many charging stalls. Worked great when arrived before 5pm but when you come at 9pm, the bakery is closed and we loose access to restrooms. Had to use the nearby fastfood place for restroom access."
Many of the chargers not working
"Many open slots when I visited. Did not reach top charge speeds (topped out at 76 kW)

Located near a convenience store"
Many open spaces. Clean bathrooms. I wish they would add picnic tables since I’m usually there for 30 minutes so I can buy and eat a hot lunch while I wait.
Many open Tesla chargers right next to newly opened travel center.
Many options while you wait
Many stalls note they are shared in sets of 4 (ABCD) So space accordingly if able
"Many stalls, coffe shop 50 ft. Away, Japanese restaurant just a few feet away (Try the Bento box for a quick lunch). Located in a mall parking lot."
Many stores here some shops here follow u. Around with no shame. U know who u are and  OK loc good parking. Handi cap  parking and lock doors ppl steel cars from this loc this mall is OK
Many Tesla chargers at the parking area near Mashpee CVS.
"Map is incorrect. Can be accessed coming from either direction on the Turnpike. Just get off at the Towanda Service Area rest stop
Nice stop!"
"Marked as a fast charger but I never got speed here. Was only Tesla around and preheated before arriving. Charger is clean and located right off of Highway 99. Large travel center with plenty to eat.

Time: 54 min
Battery: 59% -> 100%
Added: 28.99 kWh
Miles added: 119.54"
Massive Supercharger spot at the world famous Buc-ee’s! Spacious spots between your Tesla and away from the madness.
"Max 72 kW charging, but great location with access to REI, Whole Foods among other outlets. Also very close to Domain shopping center"
Maxed out at 120 kW but fortunately no other cars showed up so we didn't have to share. We found the new 8 stall v3 Supercharger down the road. Looks like it could be open any day now!
"Maxed out at 88kw charging and declined from there, not a very fast charger."
"Maxed out charger ~150kW and not busy on this holiday weekend, but could be ICEd due to most parking every other space in the parking lot. Hy-Vee has lots of food options. Good overall."
"May 2022:  There are two Tesla chargers, and two some-other-brand chargers.  The Tesla charger I used had 11KW - 12KW charge rate. It was great for overnight.   The night I stayed at the Courtyard both Tesla chargers were used, mine and someone else.  But the alternative chargers were not used that I saw."
"Maybe my favorite supercharger that I've been to. A lot of good food options nearby, easy to get to off the highway."
"Maybe the frequent question is where is the bathroom? Go straight to that fancy a$$ hotel, turn left and the bathroom in there, if you don't know where don't hesitate to ask the waitress, they are nice and they'll tell you. Maybe Elon made a great deal with them. I don't know. 🤪 stopped here a lot of times and they've been all nothing but nice. :)"
McDonald's and Wendy's are close by. The bakery remained packed while we were there. Must be good but we didn't try it.
"Mediocre location. We had to drive completely around a outlet strip mall to get to the charging location. Six chargers, and two of them are roped off with construction tape, ostensibly because they don’t work (and probably no plans to fix them soon because this site clearly isn’t frequented too often).

Avoid this location if you can. Use it only if you must.

Located behind the Gap Factory Store location at the strip mall."
Meh. Never more than 90kw on this 250 charger when I pulled in on 9% in the middle of the night and charged solo.
Meijer and Target both here for bathrooms and shopping. Not sure if it is the Tesla owners or the rest of the parking but it is normally filled with debris and other trash. Not too well lit if you go at night.
Meijer is always nice to walk around. Not many places within walking distance. And the Meijer entrance closest to the chargers closes after a certain hour.
Meijer parking lot. No shade or other amenities. Awesome 250kW power!
Mfers are lying. Nothing decent around. Have to cross over through grass/mud to get to the bathroom that’s in the gas station. AND you have to buy something to use the bathroom in any of the nearby establishment…WORSE CHARGING STOP EVER!
Mid day Thursday. 3 Teslas and 36 charging stations. Fast charged 220 miles in about 20 minutes. Just time to walk to the Carl’s Junior for a burger. Easy off and back on to the freeway.
"Might be worst SC in the US. 1 stall completely broken, 2 kept shutting down, and the rest were capped at 65 KW. Avoid unless emergency!"
"Mike into town, historical part. Town center opens at 6am and has bathrooms. Shops by also. Fast charging. Mile into town"
Minneapolis really has no Superchargers on the south side of the metro area :-(
Minus one star for lack of pull-in charger for people towing. Luckily no one else needed to use the charger I was blocking.
"Monday: Convenient location near a bunch of hotels and some restaurants. Clean, safe, fast charging. A good stop on the way to Texas.

edit-
Friday: Stopped here again on the way back north. There are 8 stalls but 2 are not functioning. (I missed that when I came through at the beginning of the week because there were only a few of us here.) All 6 of the working stalls were in use, but I only had to wait about 5 minutes for someone to leave. After I plugged in 3 more cars arrived and created a line. Even though I was the last vehicle to plug in, I was the first to leave after 18 minutes. I had enough charge to get to OKC with 18% left. No idea how long the others had to wait, but most of the vehicles that were plugged in were unoccupied, so I am guessing the owners were off at one of the restaurants.  Yikes.

There are NOT enough places to stop and charge in Oklahoma! Ardmore is a required stop for almost everyone traveling N to S in Oklahoma, unless you have a long range vehicle and don't mind being below 20% when you stop. I like to play it safe in case of storms, head winds, traffic, etc."
"More banks than I expected- for the area seemed like a pretty large Supercharger site. They are all a longer than necessary walk to the store, probably because all the truck nuts will get angry and park in them. I'll walk, but I wish it didn't have to be like this because people are small sometimes."
More Tesla chargers pls
More than 20 chargers of 250kwh at a Buc-ee’s. It’s wonderful! 👏🏼👌🏼
More than half the slots are ICEd and I think even one or two were employee vehicles (seen them before). There was slots open so I give it a 3. It is a very busy Sheetz location and can be frustrating to navigate the parking lot as it is tight in a few areas.
Most all the Tesla cars here are parked full time and make it difficult to find an empty space. It appears Tesla is not charging them after they have fully charged. Not a good thing!
"Most beautiful charger station had been, will stay in twin fall for vacation for next time"
Most chargers giving less than 50kw. Second time this has happened.
"Most disgusting location for a Tesla supercharger. Thankfully the charging speed was decent to get out of here quick. What happened to sharing charging/parking lots with nice hotels? Burger King bathroom
was nasty - and had to sneak in as they were for “paying customers” only."
Most excellent!
Most of the spot were availabe. You can go the gas station across the street.
"Most of the Superchargers are not marked. Decent location, but they have a dumpster right in front of the spots which makes it hard to back in when it's busy."
"Most of the times it’s rather empty. Great place to stretch your legs for a bit and walk your dog, if you have one. A few good places to eat in near walking distance just don’t show up too late like past 9/10pm"
Most of them works except for 1 super charger. Used to work before but not working today. I’ll leave a pic. I didn’t like that  I’ll have to pay for parking $4 for 3 hours to get my car charged.  But I do like it’s $0.27/kWh irrespective of the time of the day.
"Most similar to a gas station that I've been to, and right next to a gas station. Trash and window washing squeegee... And snow was plowed away!  Excellent Supercharger!"
"Most stations didn't work. When we found one that did, it charged at a whooping 9 miles per hour 😳."
"Mostly a good experience. Plenty of chargers and located near several shopping options. The only issue with this location were these two guys in a black crown Vic driving very slow around the chargers, staring at us as we charged. It was very strange. Not sure if it had anything to do with us being tan and the other family being Asian but these Men(who were Caucasian) drove in a car that had no indication of being security and had a confederate flag symbol on the rear end of the bumper made us all feel a bit uneasy. My car still had about 25 minutes left so I sat in the car with my family. They parked and turned around about a few parking aisles away from us and just freaking looked as us along with the other Tesla charging.

We got to this charger around 7:30pm. Next time for another road trip we will arrive a bit earlier. Just a heads up to possibly keep an eye out for these guys."
"Mostly less crowded. And one can shop at the HEB, Liquor store ar get a massage while your car charges"
"Move on. First, it's in a sketchy downtown neighborhood, blocks away from the courthouse and FBI building, with no facilities nearby.

Second, you have to pay to enter the lot, though you can get your ticket validated at nearby businesses... *if* any are open. Of course, you'd have to buy something from said business in order for your $3 ticket to be validated. Signs on every storefront say they open at 11 am, but all were closed when we tried every door at 11:10.

Sucked it up and ate the cost because we couldn't make it to a different charger. Won't be back."
"MUCH better charging speed compared to the one I used in Montreal. The ports are spaced out away from each other , I used it on my way back from Quebec. There’s a gas station within walking distance that has some surprisingly good/fresh food"
Much needed location.
Much needed supercharging location needed in the area. Located seconds off 180. Within a pretty big Sheetz gas station on Maynard Street and Burger King across the street. Car wash located next door and Wendys as well. Well lit location with 8 supercharging spots.
Multiple chargers for Tesla. The best part was going from 20% to 80% in almost 15 minutes. Lots of eating place nearby as well.
Multiple charging stalls are unusable because the hotel has decided to store snow in front of the superchargers.
Multiple instances where spots blocked by ICE vehicles. Hotel staff unsupportive.
Multiple of the chargers have been going offline as of recently. Pretty big inconvenience when it’s the only in the city :(
Must have been about 16 or so charging stations. Most were busy each time I went. I was at a nearby hotel for 4 days and went every night. I did not encounter a bad cabinet in any of the charging spots I plugged into.
"Must have build this area 2 years ago. Have to pay to access the supercharger. $3 for the first hour but we only needed it for 45 mins. It’s a good area of Birmingham. Haven’t been here since the college days. But if you want to play pickleball, there are the courts.

Don’t arrive here late because not much is open. You can charge at Mountain Brook near the Birmingham Zoo with more amenities."
My car shows this as a v2 150kw max. All 8 chargers are v3 250kw
My car shows this as a v2 150kw max. All 8 chargers are v3 250kw
My fault because I didn't know the area. I had to drive south for 4 miles to head north. I wish that I could have known sooner. I was coming home from DC.
"My favorite charging location in Dallas. ~ 16 stalls at 250kW.  Shopping, Whole Foods, and restaurants available while charging.

Great spot to charge at any hour. Space is well lit and parking lot security is seen frequently."
My favorite charging spot in between Atlanta and Charlotte. Lightning fast changing! Much faster than any of the super chargers I have visited so far. I travel alone quite frequently...and this is by far the best charger location after dark....
"My Favorite Porta potty, people always give me werid looks when I squat down to pee here though."
"My Favorite Supercharger.  Easy and quick to get in and out of from I-35.  Next to H-E-B which is a grocery store that’s open 24x7 and has everything u need and don’t need.  H-E-B restrooms r clean and at front of store. Huge wine and beer section and home made tortillas and tamales, huge selection of cheese.  Charge up before u head into San Antonio."
My favorite supercharger. It shares the parking lot with Sheetz. I wish all the charger were like this one.
"My favorite tesla supercharger in the country. Restrooms 24/7 at the pilot.  However, it is across the street so be careful. I'd recommend a cross walk put in. Love the free wine tastings at Stonehaus and we always leave with something good when they are open. Chances are 50/50 for us road trippers to catch it open."
"My firs one star review on a Tesla Supercharger, unfortunately it is too slow only 72kw, on a sketchy location and on top of that a $2 fee for accessing the parking area."
My first experience with a charger. The charger was available and worked perfectly. Others companies could learn a lot from Tesla.
My Friends parked here 4 a few so I wouldn't get lost outside.. Atlantis is a Pretty nice casino and the elevators r cool 2 look at @ night. Felt pretty safe and had fun.😀😀
"My gas powered Trick broke down there. Slit of people used the charging station while I was there. It doesnt take long to Chatham, I guess."
"My go-to Supercharger when visiting the Round Rock area.  It's a little hard to get into with the construction, but that will clear soon.  It's located between the McDonald's, Cold Stone Creamery, and Freddy's Custard.  There are 16 spots that charge up to 250kW.  I've come here several times and it's usually no more than 50-75% full and have always had fast, consistent charging speeds.

There's plenty of shops in the area to grab a bite, drink, or do some casual shopping.  Last few times I stopped by, the McDonald's interior dining area was closed, but there's several small eateries if you want to sit down or use the restroom."
"My GPS got confused and took me in the back way, but the location is very convenient. Restaurants (3) and hotel are within 50 yards, shopping mall about a 3 block walk. Equipment is new and fast. A 90 percent charge took about 55 minutes. Very good time when traveling. Good experience."
My imaginary Tesla charged while I drunk pumpkin spice coffee. 😋 Coffee from Wawa's was great
My model x broke 2 days after Tesla said bad charger
"My new favorite I-95/US1 Supercharger stop in VA!

For years I'd hit the Sheetz for Food and the Glen Allen Supercharger for fuel, but now I don't have to. There are 8x v3 (250kW / ""Superfast"") charging stalls here at a renovated Sheetz. That means you can stuff your face with all the cheesy, fried, delicious MTO food you're used to while your ride gets a snack of its own. 9 times out of 10, if you order hot food your Tesla is charged enough to get to the next leg of your trip by the time you get it. And as always, the staff here is super friendly and gives you that awesome Sheetz service.

5/5 for clean toilets, a nice fresh renewed look, the new Dolewhip machine! and an easy to pull into charging location away from the crazy traffic of the gas pumps! Also, because the Sheetz is open 24 hours, if you get here late late late at night, you still have toilets available to you (unlike you do at strip mall locations--sorry Glen Allen!)

Tips:
- Come here for superfast charging and delicious road food to take with you on your drive.
- Head a few miles south for the Glen Allen Supercharger for sit-down restaurant service and charging at a more relaxed pace (that is less likely to get you overage charges).
- Best place to evaluate traffic conditions and decide whether you want I-95/I-295 or US1 for the next leg."
"My new favorite RDU area supercharger!

[TIP: If you're coming off I-40, take the Right at the Embassy Suites hotel sign (Harrison Oaks Blvd) , then take the first Left, then turn Right after the Mr. Tire Auto center and you're there. This is faster than dealing with the light at the main entrance followed by everyone and their mother using the direct access that the BP has to the entranceway.]

First, this place has 12x, shiny, new v3 (250kW/ extra fast) Supercharger stalls that are easy to pull into and mostly out of the way of stupid parking lot traffic. Second, it's right off of I-40 so it's easy to get to whether you're traveling from one end of the state to the other, or making the regular local commute between cities.

But most importantly, WHAT A FEATURE FILLED STOP THIS IS. This shopping mall has a ton of food options available (including my go-to, award-winning, local pizza company, The Original NY Pizza). Not in the mood for fast tasty pizza? What about Thai? A Sports Pub? Chicken and Waffles?  Need a coffee or to kill 40 minutes while you charge? Stop into the excellent Meeples Brew, a friendly board-gaming cafe that will make the time zip on by.  Then of course there's the Bass Pro Shops. Nothing will make the charging time disappear like wandering the aisles thinking about what you can buy for your next hunting/fishing/camping trip. And they tend to keep pretty clean bathrooms as well.

There are two hotels nearby too, so you have a place to crash, or to ask to use the bathroom if you're stopping for a charge after 10PM.

12 out of 10 amps. I will definitely charge (and feed my car pizza) here again!"
My only complaints is that there are no trash cans and window cleaning supplies like traditionally fuel stations have. Which makes sense because there are no employees at these superchargers as they are not businesses like  service stations are. And if I’m being especially picky a restroom would be cool. Otherwise if you travel during non business hours your options are limited on where you can use the restroom.  😰
"My Rating of this Business. Drum role Plz) 🥁

My son loves his car more than me.a good place for grabbing some food while getting CHARGED FOR IT.more ways than one.(charging tesla)
My Tesla was about out of juice. Found this waiting at the end of a rainbow. Now instead of going from 60to zero I'm going from zero to sixty again.
My Uber driver used it and for a quick break I was surprised that it charged to 31% so fast
My Wife and I drove our Telsa Model Y over for a weekend stay and had good luck with the charging station provided by Sun Mountain Lodge. There are two Tesla level 2 chargers and one non-Tesla - the Tesla chargers that we used operated at 48A at 208V. We left our car charging several times while eating at one of the restaurants or out hiking. We were able to add enough range to drive around for the weekend and to make it back home in Bothell without having to stop.
"My wife and I passed through Globe on our way to Tucson and we found that one of these two Tesla Destination Chargers did not work, and the other one got about 8 kwh of charging speed. The front desk charged us $10 to use it since we weren't guests of the hotel.."
"Nav had a bit of a problem with the no-left turn intersections, but easy on and off.  Ate at Panera during the stop.  $.36 per KWH was a bit high, but c'est la vie."
Navigation to the charger wasn't great but it's part of the gas station and grocery store parking lot on the south side. Place was convenient and safe.
Navigation was very confusing on trying to locate charge station and lots of construction in the area.  Nice grassy area to walk dogs - beware there is lots of trash and debris you’ll need to avoid while walking your dog. No trash cans near by or general store.  Highly recommend grabbing food or a snack before you stop to charge.  Plenty of chargers and did not have to wait to plug in.
"Near 24hr gas station. Trashcans available right next to Tesla charger, windshield sponges at the nearby station. Grassy area nearby where you can walk a pet. Clean facility overall, good enough restroom. Negative was we went through a toll plaza to get from 76 northbound to this location."
"Near a good restaurant, can walk down to the water, and they function as chargers. Win-win"
"Near a mall that reminds of the 80’s.  Well lit.  At least there are bathrooms in the mall.  There’s a Petco, TJMaxx, ULTA, Ross and Walmart. Got about 179 miles an hour on average."
Near amenities. It’s in the parking lot of a Woodman’s grocery store that has clean restrooms and a variety of food. It’s also by a McDonald’s so if Woodman’s doesn’t have the food your looking for you can always grab a quick bite from there.
Near gas station. Good one
Near Hy-Vee and Starbucks. Parks across the street.
Near Starbucks and Harris Teeter and Mod Pizza.
"Near to fast food, grocery , highway .
Very convenient"
"Nearby Cracker Barrel.
Very nice."
Nearby Starbucks. Made our 1 & 1/2 hour drive back to the IE from Sea World an easy one stop recharge for both me and the car in the evening.
"Nearest bathrooms are to your right as you exit your supercharging car; enter the market front door and head left. The food in the market was mostly basic chips and soda. With only two other cars here, at 5:30 PM on a Sunday, I found the charge rate was a speedy 600+ miles per hour."
"Nearest stripmall is a mile away, but there is a hotel. The views are great. If nothing else charging while you check out the scenery is worth it"
"Neat little spot to charge overnight, trickle charging here so I can make it to the local supercharger inland"
"Necessary stop as part of our 1500 mile road trip in the model 3.
Wish it was closer to highway 55... edit after walking the streets and exploring the shops, bars, restaurants we will be using this as and overnight stop on our next trip."
"Necessary!

Whether heading N, S, E or W this station is a must!

The Supercharger Station is actually behind Andersons Pea Soup. It's tucked away in a hook back towards the highway (dead ends behind Andersons)."
Need a trash càn!!!
Need more supercharger in the happy valley AND at the base of Mountain !! (Milroy and Reedsville Areas) !!
Need one in college station!!!! Ran out of power in College station had to get a tow over to this super charger. Keep in mind its 40 miles from college station.
Need to be a hotel guest to charge.
Need to work on there chargers they have one broke for a week now an the charge rate is getting worse here at this station.  Also wait times are getting worse time for two Tesla stations in Boulder COLORADO. Right an ICE SUV should Park in a reg. Spot an not a charging spot.
"Need way more chargers!  Says not usually busy, but every time I come I wait for a charger."
Needed to charge in Branson but no superchargers installed yet.  Had to use the destination charger while shopping.   Did the trick but plan to shop most of the day to allow to fully charge up.  Walking the old town and riverfront area was nice
Needs 3 more charging stations and a place to eat.
"Needs to be more stations & faster charges, otherwise not bad. Very different feeling than gasing up😝"
"Neither charger works, both stopped charging after 30 minutes and wouldn't restart."
Neither the Tesla destination charger nor the J 1772 charger work.
Never a wait. Two hotel lobbies to choose from. Be careful entering as the parking lot has major pot holes
Never any wait time. and it's a 250kw station on my way to work in Wilmington.
"Never been full, conveniently located. Never had any trouble with a charger, either! Glad they expanded it though - it's kept the first point from above true!"
"Never busy, and lots of things to do while I’m charging."
"Never come here, $7 dollars an hour? Fine I guess.... But it's valet only, they park it and charge it for you. Not about to let someone else drive my car. Took one look and left."
Never crowded over 30 charging pionts plus you can visit the mall while you wait.
"Never had a problem here. Lots of chargers and under-ultilized. Supermarket, Asian food, and Donuts all in the strip mall. After hours would be bad, but during the day there are facilities."
Never had a problem with this charger.
"Never had an issue with this supercharger. It's handy to have it next to Hy-Vee, to run inside and grab some quick things while it charges"
"Never had to wait for a spot; however, I wish the chargers were 250kW capacity.  A trash can would be helpful too."
Never heard of a tesla supercharger with a time limit. Do gas pumps have a time limit ? Every 10 minutes it stopped charging.
"Never in my wildest dreams did I think an electric vehicle charging station would be here when growing up in the 80’s in Rockingham, but here we are… 5 stars cause this is home, but a meh in terms of options around."
"Never really crowded, quick charge, drinks and food available nearby, and avail yourself of the free tire air!"
Never too busy (except maybe on holidays). Just off I-66 near Manassas. I use it regularly to top off when going and coming to Winchester. In the parking lot of Sheetz. Back-n approach to 8 chargers.
"Never too busy charging station behind a Subway. Also a Huddle House, MacDonalds & Popeyes nearby."
"New (Nov 2022) and good location with a few restaurants in easy walking distance. Area is busy in winter, but plenty of charging stands."
"New 12 stalls, all quite at night but very well lit. A little walk to Dave and Busters for restrooms. Mall near by."
"New 8 stall super charger station between Austin and Houston in the little town of Giddings. Sandwich shop and convenience store. Oh, and a fenced in dog walking area right behind the chargers. And a picnic table too!!"
New always spots! Decent retail area.
New area! Places to eat and it’s clean!
New chargers in front of Publix.
"New chargers.  Order and sit down, very nice cafe, with full breakfast options inside Hy-Vee"
New charging station at a very convenient spot. Thanks Tesla!
"New fast supercharger site at great location.  I've been traveling through Kingman since I bought my 2018 m3 and all they had until now was a slow, often full charging site in a Carl's Jr lot.  This one is in the parking lot of the Kingman  Visitors center and museum.   Bathrooms inside when open or nearby when not."
"New installation of 16 chargers.  Nice job of blending with the community with landscaping and a cute wooden fence.  Shares the parking lot with Dan's food market.  Inside Dan's is a Deli with hot sandwiches, we had one called Wild Turkey.  Next door is a small, new McDonald's.  To kill some time, it's a short walk to more shops and restaurants in the center of town."
"New location, great addition to the network. Silverthorne and Glenwood were the only options before this was added, great for the greater Vail valley.
There are EV chargers for other vehicles here too, progress."
New March 2023. 24 chargers. Very convenient to Interstate. Several restaurants within walking distance. Buc-ee's parking lot is so large that some restaurants are closer than Bucc-ee's
New operational charger in the parking lot of a neat restaurant/cafe.
New set of chargers in Frederick in the new Sheetz station. Not the easiest charger to get to especially if you are towing a trailer. We were able to use the pull-in charger so we did not have to unhook the trailer.
New sign on the charger that says it’s for Best Western guests only. Aka it will sit empty 99.9% of the time.
"New station 2022, has Starbucks, few other fast food, enclosed grass and bench seating area which is extremely rare."
"New station. No #s on the supercharger.
End charger seems too far forward. I couldn’t use it. Fast charging."
"New Supercharger Stations in Westlake!  Clean, safe & convenient."
New superchargers on Warren Street one block off of 395 in Bishop. We got 62 kW but had a partial charge at the time so higher kW on a lower starting charge.
New Tesla Supercharger location north of The Woodlands! Located next to Car Toys store. 8 stalls available and plenty of places to grab some good food!
New Tesla supercharger outside of World Market & Total Wine. Chargers work well and are located on the back edge of the parking lot in a well lit area.
New V3 chargers are extremely fast! Was able to pull  249KWh  charge rates on my 2021 model Y.  Charged here 3 times and was always the only vehicle charging.
"New V3 for Memphis, along actual travel route, and a Target. A+."
New V3 Supercharger in Auburn! Very convenient location.
New V3 superchargers installed waiting to be turned on. The 6 fast chargers are only 72kw on parking level 1. Plus there’s another 6 destination chargers if you’re going to spend a few hours shopping or dining.
"New V3 Tesla Superchargers.
This supercharging station also has couple of windshield washers and garbage can. A convenience store is nearby for quick snack and coffee."
"New-ish Supercharger in a handy location. Six stalls, very well maintained. Sheetz store is probably less than average for amenities and cleanliness… but has everything you need while charging. Have safe travels!"
"New, fast (250kW) Superchargers packed into a very busy Wawa, but I've only seen the stalls half full. The high speed means you can get your charging done fast(by the time your get your hot food order served by Wawa), and the placement near the entrance means you won't have to drive around back.  It does also mean you have to watch that you don't get T-boned by cars coming in to use the gas pumps as you back into a space, but the spaces are wide and easily accessible. Like most Wawa locations around here you'll find plenty of snacks, prepared foods, a really delicious hot food selection, coffee and more importantly, trashcans and recycling for you to toss away your old road food.  The bathrooms here needed more cleaning, but everyone's shorthanded these days. They're probably better during less busy hours.  If you can stand that, this makes for a very good stop on your way north or south."
New.  Great location.  Clean and not busy.
"Newer 250KWH 8 stall charger in the NE corner of the Meijer parking lot with a Jimmy Johns and Panera Bread close by.  Also 3-4 other fast food places within driving distance.

Used on 6/11/2022 as well as 6/12.  Plenty of open spaces and charged our M3 long range in 15-20 minutes.

A welcome relief to the other Indy loop charger.

update 1/15/2023 : Arrived about 6:00pm and found 1 charger in use. Charged our M3LR from 28% to 73% in 13 minutes.  Almost too quick to walk to the Meijer's to visit the bathrooms."
Newer super charger stalls on a less busy turnpike rest stop.
"Newer thicker lead cables and a super fast charge.  First time it's ever added the advertised 200 miles in 15 minutes, but only one other model 3 plugged in."
"Newer, 250kwh, safe location. The gas station was newer, very clean, and had a food market with healthier options."
"Newly built, much faster charging than the old one. Also more slots available."
"Newly open Tesla Supercharger, not so busy. Approximately 5 minutes drive after exit from Route 46, 80, not so easy to find as it’s on internal road.

Sign on charting station says 30 minutes “General Parking” is allowed. There is also a designated Handicap changing station (first time I saw).

On Wawa parking lot, where you can find quick bites, refreshments, restrooms, and cheap gas. Sorry not applicable for Tesla owners!"
"Newly opened, bunch of spots(16 I believe). You do need to pay parking for American Dream to get in. Very close to AD entrance, so that’s nice. Charging is supposed to be quick but so am only get 150mile/h, even though I am the only car charging there, not sure why."
"Next to a busstop with some unsavory folks at night. Don't stop here at night, go a little further to the one near the hyvee. Much safer area."
"Next to a sheetz and in, what seems, to be a safer area with plenty of chargers available.  Thanks Tesla for the awesome charing network!"
Next to a sheetz to food and drinks are available.  In a busier area but I haven't had issues with chargers being available.  No other issues. Thank you for the awesome charing network Tesla!
Next to a Tim Hortons and a dinner
"Next to a Wawa so drinks and food available. Safer area, nice and new. Thank you Tesla for the awesome supercharging Network!"
"Next to a Wawa so food to ear, seems to be a cleaner and safer area to charge. No issues.  Thanks Tesla for the awesome charing network!"
Next to hy-ve store very convenient.
Next to mall and lots of restaurants here.  Very convenient.
"Next to Meijer.
Total 8 stalls
150 kW max

Charging fees as of 9/12/22 -   $0.41/ kWh (all day)

Cleanliness 4/5"
Next to Smithfield BBQ & Lowes. Just off the road. No one there either time I was there. Fast
"Next to Star Line Ferry in an area of Mackinaw City dense with hotels and restaurants. Many restaurants in the area are closed for the season, but at least a couple across the street are still open.

We didn't test it, but the cable on one charger is hanging down, so it may not be working?

Fast charging! We will be going to Manistique and back from here in 35 degree weather, so we will be relying on the Tesla destination charger at the Adoba motel in Naubinway to make it back here."
Next to subway and Dunkin’ Donuts .. and other restaurants .. super fast as well.
"Next to the big supermarket, convenient."
"Next to the cutest gosh darn park this side of the Mississippi. In case it gets busy, there are plenty of benches to choose from. The water fountain was overly aggressive but balanced by the tranquil environment provided by the resident styrofoam deer. Favorite station yet. I wish I could give it 6 stars because there was no Arby’s in sight. Who even goes there?"
Next to Triggs grocery. Great store
Next to Wawa. Busy on Saturday afternoon
Nice
"Nice 12 post install with plenty of V3 chargers.  Wasn't busy either time I stopped here - I was the only car both times.  I really like superchargers at convenience stores/gas stations - so nice to be able to just run in, use restroom, grab snacks, and move on."
Nice 120kwh supercharging station with quite a few shops nearby.
Nice 2 stations here. Very handy for our way to Capitol Reef
Nice addition along HWY 36 and very conveniently located at the Altenhofen Inn & Suites.
"Nice alternative to the toll road Orlando SC and fooodless boring St. Aug SC. Short walk to restaurants, specially Olive Garden. Clean, but next to trash bins like these SC end up in"
Nice always available n good place to hang out while charging
Nice and clean
"Nice and Clean , Empty mid day in a weekend , garbage can on spot that is the plus ! :)"
Nice and clean area for charging
"Nice and clean location.   Sheeze gas station with clean bathrooms, hot coffee, drinks, and made to order fast food.  Excellent location!"
Nice and clean. But wait till the lower class start getting EVs then charging areas will need armed guards . Trash will be every where
Nice and clean..Plenty of charging stations...
"Nice and convenient, 250kw charger."
Nice and convenient.
"Nice and convenient. Walmart, Qdoba, Wawa within very close proximity."
Nice and fast charging station in a not busy shopping area with a lot of room to maneuver (for those towing something). For those that love bubble tea - there is a Ding Tea nearby with a very clean restroom.
Nice and fast V3 chargers with a 24 hour gas station/truck stop. Good bathrooms and plenty of food options.
"Nice and fast, V3 charger.. Good food options nearby."
Nice and free station 10kw just perfect
Nice and open area! A lot to walk around and see while charging. Only issue so far is if a person with 3 mirrors and 3 cameras needs more than 1 spot.
Nice and quiet place to relax and charge
Nice and quiet place. Not that super fast few cars charging.
Nice area and close to Bass Pro Shops and Duluth.  Charge was fast on 1B....... And 3 blue beauties spotted in the wild!
Nice area and close to shops and restaurants.
Nice area for a walk while charging. Hotel was clean and had good bathrooms.
"Nice area to have a charger, but really slow only 65kw to start on a fully preconditioned car at 20% state of charge"
"Nice area to stop charge, eat and shop if you need to. There is a 20% discount in the Texas dinner for Tesla owners were you park at. I didn't give it a 5 star because there was about 8 chargers, however it was not an issue I didn't have to wait. For the 30 minutes that I was there, there was always a charger open."
Nice area. Restrooms and food close by. Easy in and out.
Nice area...great shops nearby especially the Sweet Shop if you would rather have a great snack in your Tesla while charging. Close to public restrooms
Nice big lot. Close to a gas station/mini mart and a Wendy’s. Grab that frosty and dip those fries in it while you wait. Charger is also much faster than any other options close by.
Nice big lot. Good amount of chargers. Haven’t had to wait here much.
"Nice but no restrooms, no trash cans. Area is decent though"
Nice charger
"Nice charger at a hotel in a small town. Nice green grass lawn, a few local businesses, restrooms available at the motel. 2 of the 4 chargers appear to be out of order (July 2019)"
Nice charger but had to unhitch trailer to charge. However there was an RV parking spot across the road. Overall hard to get into because it was on the side of a road and you had to potentially back across traffic.
"Nice charger next to a convenience store. A neat feature was that there was a dog walking area for one’s pets. Note that we were there on a Thu at 8:30pm and all of the restaurants in the convenience store were closed, you could still get snacks from the gas station but the actual restaurants were closed."
"Nice charger, but beware no pull in spot if towing. Google maps location is slightly off, does not recognize that you are at the location. Cannot easily see the charging stations from road. Just past the propane tank, recessed into bank at the Cenex"
Nice chargers attached to the public library. Charges at 48A for the Tesla chargers.
Nice charging location just by a restaurant you can go and grab a bite while your car gets some juice.
Nice charging location.  We walked across the street and had taco while we waited to top off our charge.
Nice charging speeds and spacious location. Though there are no cofee shops here and no thrash cans nearby :)
"Nice charging station in affluent South Barrington shopping plaza. Located in the Arhaus parking lot.
Tesla navigation was a little glitchy and at first sent me to Volta charging station, then did not give me the proper turn by turn.
Go to Arhaus, and you're right there!"
Nice charging station located in wawa
Nice charging station next to a shake and steak.
Nice charging stations next to many restaurants and a really nice Target.
Nice charging stop. Chargers are on the right side of the building.  Seemed like a  newly opened station when I was there.
"Nice charging. Plug in, go in for restroom, deli and back out for just a 15min charge time."
"Nice clean charging station. There are a couple of gas stations, a motel 6, barbecue joint, and a couple of other restaurants within walking distance. Stopped by about 4 pm on a Saturday afternoon and there were still several stalls open."
Nice clean well kept at the time I went there was empty besides one car everything/ all Chargers were working (Seems to be)
Nice destination charger for guests of Cedar Lodge.  It charges at 48 amps & approx 11.4 kW.  Located right next to the cabins.  Was very convenient during our stay and was much appreciated.
"Nice family stay at the HGI. I counted eight Tesla Chargers.
Most of time six or seven were iced. They all have Tesla signs marking them. Management needs to do more otherwise EV owners will go elsewhere."
Nice fast 8-bay supercharger in good repair in the parking lot of Casey's General Store. Decent bathrooms in there. Minimal detour from the freeway.
Nice fast charge in a parking lot bursting with fall colors. Chargers are at an outlet mall. There is an Ingles grocery across the street.
"Nice fast charge, 251 kW. Across from bowling alley and next to Courtyard Marriott property. Circle K gas station a short walk away with bathrooms. May not be the safest place at night, but can't really say as I was there around 5:30 pm. Convenient to I 95 for a quick charge!"
Nice Fast charger
Nice fast charger but no services nearby and a long walk to the unlocked door of the main Grand Geneva entrance for bathrooms. Using their bathroom facilities is a little strange in that you need to get let into the indoor pool and use their locker room as the bathroom. There is a nice little park for kids but otherwise not much else happening here.
Nice fast charging but lots of non Tesla cars parked in stalls.
Nice fast clean supercharger. Casey's has good pizza and if you order when you get there your pizza will be ready when your car is done charging.
Nice free charge located at the Courtyard Hotel.
nice good truck stop 👍👍👍
Nice grocery store attached. Fast charging wasn't busy when I stopped after lunch time.
"Nice it's at the Wawa. Easier to access than the SC in Annapolis. Not a great layout, sharing space with the tire inflator and there's not clear indicator which side to park. Plus the usual spots being taken up by ICE cars."
"Nice Level 3 Tesla Supercharger attached to Wawa for Food, Bathrooms and drinks"
Nice little area to stop. Grassy area with seats and basketball courts. No dog pooping on grass according to sign. Charging station lines are all over the the place.
"Nice little town and general area, but a little sketchy getting to the charger. Location is at the back end of a hotel parking lot through an odd set of intersections. If you're stopping for a combo food and recharge, grab food at one of the restaurants down the road first because there are no quick options within walking distance. Hotel does have restroom facilities available. Biggest complaint is the cost of $0.46kwh, which was steeper any others along our route. If you NEED to stop here, it's fine, but we probably would plan for a cheaper and more convenient one in the future."
Nice little truckstop. Quiet and clean. Great for a Electric car charge. Wendy's restaurant and convenient store are within a few steps.
"Nice Lobby, attentive staff. Good environment 🤗, no outlets 😓"
"Nice location
Used local facilities nearby before getting back on the road.
Located not far off the interstate and close to hotel too if you need to crash."
"Nice location (near the beach, shops, and restaurants). Charging rate is a max of 150kW and less when busy. Barely reached 60kW due to all chargers being used. Very pricey during peak hours. Best to use before 10am or after 7pm. Rate is double between 10am and 7pm."
Nice location and works well. I like having it at convenience station as opposed to store parking lots.
"Nice location away from the busy parking lot. Only 12 stations and a lot of Tesla owners in the area. Pretty much everyone is kind and patient. Personally, I haven't waited more than 20 minutes for a station to free up."
"Nice location but only charges 60 kWh.  Was the only one charging, so don’t know why it’s so slow."
Nice location but slow charger. Starbucks and Chikfilet are in walking distance.
"Nice location for a neighborhood supercharger.  These max out at 72kW so they are slow compared to other supercharger locations close by.  Such is the nature us neighborhood superchargers.  For me, I just needed a small charge to keep me going so it worked out great for me.  Seems like there are a lot open stalls due to a faster supercharging location close by."
"Nice location next to Target, with a Del Taco and Jack in the Box steps away, with plenty of other options within a 5 min walk across the street (Chipotle, Panera, Taco Bell, Carls Jr, KFC). 150kW holds back a star."
"Nice location not on interstate but close enough. Beware the Greenwise, though. Nice facilities but they don’t staff their drink bar adequately. Better off walking over to Starbucks if you want coffee."
Nice location right next to the Tesla Store. The store is closed during COVID-19 so you have to walk down to the Target for restrooms.
"Nice location right off the highway. Next to a Chevron station with a Circle K convenient store. Bathroom is clean an accessible, plenty of drinks and snacks. Some outside seating with table and shade to wait for charging."
Nice location very nice great security cameras
Nice location with 150kW chargers. It is at a Wawa
"Nice location with many amenities (stores, restaurants, etc.), Including Altamonte Mall, & close to I-4.  Just wish Tesla would build these stations with wider parking spaces to help avoid door dings..."
"Nice location with only one small issue. Please read on…

It is next to the Bay Plaza Mall; so, you can do a lot while you wait and charge your vehicle (shop, eat, work-out in the Gym, etc.).

Only downside: You have to pay for parking to exit the lot ($3).

Other than that, this location is one of the best in the area. 4/5 stars."
"Nice Location, 250 kw works great!  10 Stalls"
"Nice location, except for navigating to it. Until they fix the navigation, I recommend navigating to Starbucks as it's so close to the chargers, but navigation can handle the roads to a shopping center location. Otherwise, nice location near plenty of fast food and a Sheetz for snacks."
"Nice location, next to Meijer, Chipotle, Panda. But I rarely get over 60kW, even if I'm the only car, starting at 10%."
"Nice location, plenty of food choices in the area... still"
"Nice location, very slow charge."
Nice location.
Nice location.
Nice location. Also a small loop trail next to it for stretching your legs.
Nice location. Easy access from highway. Use google map first time. Tesla navigation will guide you go right at the end but you should go in parking lot between battery plus and Panera bread. Lots of good places to eat. Charging was fast and lots of available slots.
Nice location. Got up to 195kW so I'm sure it goes 250 in the summer.
Nice location. Have lot of shops near by if you want to shop around while your Tesla is charging. You get off peak hour rates on Sunday
Nice location. In Meijer parking lot. Starbucks inside. It was relaxing and shady today. Getting 350 mi/hr charge.
Nice location. Peaked at 197 kW with 5 Teslas charging. McDonalds and Grocery store in same parking lot. Forward parking slots.
"Nice location. Short walk to a Thai place, a pizza place, and Lilo's Hawaiian BBQ.
You can grab a bite to eat while your car charges."
Nice location. Steak and shake next door and a 24/7 place across the street. Parking lots to walk around in and functional chargers.
Nice location. The shopping center has plenty of options while you're charging. There are only eight chargers.  They need more.  It was either full with cars waiting when I arrived or became full while I was there.
Nice location. Wawa station. Other adventures across the street.
"Nice new 250 kwik charger. Nothing for amenities, but right by a KwikTrip, McDonalds, Arbys, and grocery store."
Nice new 250kW charger to bridge getting between Bend and Boise. Some broken glass in the lot so be careful leaving your ride here for a long time. Walking distance to grocery outlet and McD. Safeway down the block a mile.
Nice new 3rd gen 250 charger.   In the Culver parking lot.
Nice new charger 👍
Nice new charger.   Subway parking lot.   Relatively full most times I've visited.
Nice new charger.  Really close to the Marathon - as close as the gas pumps.  Easy off I-64 on Route 41.
Nice new charging location. Lots of spaces and easy access.
"Nice new Sheetz. Agree with others, kinda slow. Getting 50-70kW and I’m the only one here. Easy place to stop."
Nice new supercharger at a Wawa. I was able to achieve 990 mph into a refreshed Tesla Model S.
"Nice pit stop,  there would have been no waiting if people returned to their car when the charging is finished."
Nice place but I didn’t see a convince store or restrooms around. it’s inside a open format mall so there are clothing stores and some restaurants. But you gotta walk a block or two through the parking lot to get to any of them.
"Nice place for a quick charge. Do you best to leave one empty spot on each side for the best and fastest charge. The charging station is in a Target parking lot. It makes it very convenient to charge while you do your shopping. This station is also close to Lowe's, and walking distance to In-N-Out. Overall great place to charge. We visit often."
"Nice place for a supercharger. Collin St Bakery has coffee, baked goods and sandwiches. Clean bathrooms. There is patio seating, as well as inside seating. A gas station is right across the street as well."
"Nice place to charge, while waiting you can grab food or visit bestbuy or across the street to the mall.

The cons? Sometimes even you are the only one in there the charging is very slow, it will take time to complete your charge even you have preheat your battery."
Nice place to stop and charge convenient to I-40. Gas station with restroom was a short walk away (maybe 5 minutes) and a Bojangles close to that. There were also trash cans (Nice to have after eating at Bojangles)! Not busy for a Saturday in the summer (around 5 PM). I had no waiting (only one or two other vehicles charging the 30-40 minutes that I was there).
Nice place to stop. Cool train to look at.
Nice place with fast Tesla supercharger support for New Yorkers .
Nice place.
nice place.
Nice quiet charging location right off the hi-way. The nearby outlet mall is great for shopping or walking the parking lot after hours to stretch your legs.
"Nice quiet place to charge. Located behind the Diamond Mountain Casino.  There is a Doorway with a ""buzzer"" that will provide entry to the Casino, for Public restrooms are food options. Well lit at night with decent area to walk a Dog, plenty of cats running around to entertain the travel weary Dog.  Options are limited for food choices outside of the Casino area."
Nice rest stop area
"Nice safe location, outside of Sheetz.
You can charge as much as you want past 80%, but as you would guess, rate of charge goes down some past 80%.
Was picking up s puppy in Virginia in a charging desert. Stopped here both ways."
Nice secluded area. It may be a bit hard to find - turn at the intersection and then go to the farther side of the parking lot.
"Nice setup in the middle of the strip.  V3 is so fast!  You do need to press the assistance button to gain entry to the lot.  You then get a code to get a parking tag good for 1 hour free, and they charge parking after that.  It only took about 35 minutes for me to go from 15-80%"
"Nice setup! Easy access, well maintained area and the Casey's that's hosting it keeps a squeegee, cleaner and paper towels handy at the charges. Plus Casey's provides a nice break and place to get snacks or a slice of pizza. Highly recommended. Charge regularly at 250kw."
Nice shopping area where supercharger station is located.
Nice shopping center. Lot's of stores and restaurants around it. And new restaurants being built as well that are getting ready to open soon.
"Nice site away from convenience store parking, so less competition for spaces with ICE vehicles. Easy to see from the street. Clean restrooms and decent charge speeds (250kW+ achieved). Attached to a subway. No other options for food but no outlet road was nice for a brief walk (sand pipers, red wing black birds and wild grasses before the corn field)."
"Nice spot away from the busy main street so hopefully not too many parking issues.   Only about a 2 min walk to the shops.   Watch your charging time, we ate at the place across from the cafe and by the time we got our food the car was charged to 100%.

Another Tesla owner thankfully told us this was open when we were charging at murdo, relieved any concern about range through the badlands."
"Nice spot the entrance is on the main street and through the Eldorado parking garage. There are many parking slots for electric vehicles. Good rates, cheaper to charge in the early morning and night time. Would definitely use again, especially since it's downtown and close to many different shops and stores."
Nice spot to charge
"Nice spot to charge, easy and free. Last time I visited every stall was blocked by an ICE car, so I had to park off to the side to charge. I wish they could put up more obvious signs or enforce this better."
"Nice spot, critical location, wish was faster w/ V3/250kw stalls... new site w/ v3 is being planned nearby, that will help.
Bigger concern is the 2-stall drive-thru setup, and lack of direction arrows, eg which end/direction to drive into!
Parking lot entrance is on north side, but you need to drive into stalls from back(south) side (trees on left, power cabinets on right)... or else you end up using the OTHER column's cable, and then one entire column is lost. Happened to me when nearly full... and can't park outside the stalls, since the ends are blocked by that tree and power equipment"
"Nice spot, good hotel bathroom. Town pump across the street is well stocked, there's a dozen restaurants in a 5 minute walk as well as a grocery store, REI, sportsman's warehouse, etc."
Nice spot! Charges at ~40miles/hr while u get some food/drink and watch the boats go by.
"Nice spot....The Bean is a nice coffee shop, just a 10 sec walk away.  There is a small grocery store as well."
Nice stop
Nice stop right near the Fair Oaks Farm. Lots to do here.
"Nice stop- super nice restroom in hotel, lots of snacks for purchase, and well manicured lawn for lounging."
"Nice stop, window washers, garbage can and convenient mart with nice bathrooms."
Nice stop.  WaWa pretzels are the best.
"Nice stop. Clean and plenty of spaces. Locates in a shopping strip, so plenty of restrooms and a few places ro get food."
"Nice super charger, it is located next to Clayton Ranch Market. Restroom options are limited, just one for Men’s. Food plan to buy from the market or the Pizzahut opposite."
"Nice super charger. Whole Foods is always clean and has good stuff. Well lit.

Only negative is other cars will sometimes park in spots"
Nice supercharger  right next to WaWa. Close to all kinds of shopping.
"Nice supercharger in the middle of a lot. IHOP,  Dave and buster, pet smart, target. Only wish there was a trash can and a bathroom overnight"
Nice supercharger tucked just off the main drag when you come up to Sturgeon Bay as if you’re going to Target!  Glad to finally have the ability to charge up here!
"Nice supercharger, has a gas station with a little deli and gift shop."
Nice supercharger. Better than the one on Gardiner lane. Grocery and fast food in the same parking lot. Felt safe to charge here.
"Nice superchargers on the backside parking lot of Fred Meyer. 8 stalls, 150kW."
Nice Tesla stop by the mall and the bass pro shop. Trash can easily accessible.  There is a Tru Hilton near by for over night bathroom breaks but the mall has bathrooms for during the day
Nice Tesla super charger stop with convenient store located in the lot that has great food available.
"Nice that it's not too busy but it felt like slow charging. I got tired of watching the charging speed yo-yo between 0 and 30 kW (124 mi/hr), so went over to Nupa to bored eat. I recommend their gyros.

We came back to the car and the only other car that was charging was right next to ours. It's like the bathroom urinals... leave at least a space between...

UPDATE: Came back the next day to top off before heading back to the cities and it was doing up to 147 kW (600 mi/hr). And there were 2 other cars charging at the same time (and they were appropriately spaced)."
"Nice that it's right off the highway, although the general area seems a bit sketchy. Would be concerend after dark. Grocery store does have a restroom, but it's way in the back, in the employee only area.
Disheartening the charges have risen more than gasoline, it's now cheaper, and faster in a gasoline car."
Nice that it’s a Tesla charger but the location of the plug in station is located closer to the passenger side so the cord doesn’t reach the power port very easily. I tried pulling the car in front first as well and it still wouldn’t reach. Had to hug the far stall to get the cord to connect.
"Nice to be able and charge quickly, it’s obvious Reno is in need of more chargers between Atlantis and El Dorado.
Sadly, the car next to me did not care about their fellow Tesla owners, car was unplugged and blocking anyone else from using the space. Anyone aware of a way to report folks blocking usage?"
Nice to have 8 stalls. Sitting in a spot that was easy to see a great view.
Nice to have a convenience store with bathrooms right beside. Short walk to timmies and DQ.
"Nice to have a destination charger if you stay at Bayshore, but as others have said the multiple chargers are often blocked by non-EV cars. We lucked out and fully charged overnight (for free). Not the best hotel but better than most others in the area."
Nice to have at a Sheetz with clean restrooms.  Recommend calling ahead while charging to Shahi Dhaba next door to order some amazing Indian food.
Nice to have Tesla super chargers here.
"Nice to pull in to charge. Decent speed of charging. If you are charging outside of mall hours, no bathrooms."
"Nice v3 (250 kW) charger, so getting 1000 miles of charge per hour when we started. Lots of things to do, but we are on a road trip across the country and don't want to waste time shopping.

V3 superchargers are great for this! In at 15% and out at 80% in 15 minutes..."
Nice well lit place by the Wawa to charge up your EV. You can chill out and even get a shorty and coffee at the Wawa while you wait. Did this at midnight and never at any point felt unsafe.
Nice when I park next to it when I go into Ray's grocery store I have a gas car my Honda civic gets amazing miles about 48 per mile I'm happy 😁
"Nice, brand new supercharger station. Tricky to get to if you turn early"
"Nice, clean and always a charge. All charges are all in good working condition."
"Nice, clean and safe SC. Very fast charging. Not crowded."
"Nice, clean and super friendly. This is a very amazing establishment. Gas, food, gifts, pretty much anything you can think of, and more."
"Nice, clean, and relatively fast charging. Looks like a safe place to charge at night as well. There were three Teslas including mine at the time of this review. It was a nice sunny day so my dog and I walked around the hotel a few times to stretch out a bit. Didn't need to use the restroom so I'm not sure what the hotel bathrooms are like. Cell reception (att) is solid with 5g and full bars."
"Nice, long cord that covers four spots. Tesla connector with 32A draw at 210V for 28 mi/hr rate.  Also has a generic charger with padlock.  Guessing that can be unlocked upon request.  BTW, very tasty Italian food at the restaurant!"
"Nice, lots of chargers, super convenient. All the stores in the shopping center open at 10 am though so I was here before that and couldn’t go browse!"
"Nice, new charger on the side of the Cenex station. If you have time, make a little drive to Tongue River Winery up the road for a a little Montana fruit wine."
"Nice, new, and underutilized supercharger at a Wawa."
"Nice, quiet corner of town, next to a gas station store, across the street from a restaurant."
"Nice, safe location to stop. Just a heads up that the Hyatt won’t allow you to use the restroom unless you’re staying there."
nice!
Nice.
"Nice. Has Fast 8 Ports Tesla Supercharger stalls. Does a great job. Has relatively big store for a gas station. QuickChek has MANY hot and cold drink options great good fast food options with many hot customized sandwiches, soups and hot dogs. No hamburgers. Looks nice inside too. Has large bathrooms inside for both men and women."
"Nice. Hit 372 mph on 1A. Tons of shopping and eating options nearby, if you go in for the corporate concepts. How many Teslas will it take till someone will be offering massage services at the charging stations!?"
Nice. We stayed there charging our Tesla Model 3 last week and it was fine and smooth. Better if you take something for having there while waiting. Some people just stays or walk around while this.
Nicely lighted during the night. Conveniently next to the freeway as well.
Nicely located spot with plenty of food and retail choices in the plaza. Spots are a little tight to back into when it's busy.
Nicely located supercharger along 35! We no longer have to take a detour onto 90 to charge up. We peaked at 130kW at this charger. Trail's Travel Center is just across the street with a bunch of food options while you wait.
Nicely placed 250KW chargers. Our MXP was close to full charge by the time we finished our dinner at Pizza Hut.
Night time charging here.  A great location for sure.
Night time security here is top notch.
No bathroom available on the weekend.  Walked to a Taco Bell for my wife to use one.  Not my idea of how a customer buying a luxury vehicle should be treated.  Shameful.
"no bathrooms nearby, homeless people, might feel a little sketchy at night"
No cable
No charger
no charger here.....
No charger. Removed.
"No excuses!!! This is a well lit RIGHT OFF 95 charging station. The gas station, store and restaurant was all good...just the Tesla people littering...note how close the trashcan is to where they threw their garbage out...not cool!!! I had to step over a cup, 2 Chick-fil-A boxes and on the other side of my car to get my dog were 2 more Chick-fil-A boxes in tesla area...no other littering around the area!"
"No food or bathrooms nearby, but there was a carnival and the trailers all the traveling workers stay in at the site. Perfect at 1 am after hours on the road lol"
"No I didn't visit it, have a New Chevy Trax,gas vehicle"
"No issues , good location."
No issues charging. Quick walk to Circle K down a short grass path or an Exxon across a two-lane road.
"No issues here, quick and convenient off the highway, only one here on a Sunday night."
"No issues the chargers are on the second floor across from the target parking garage, enjoy!"
"No issues, all chargers are usually put away neatly I prefer this location over New London as they also have more chargers! They also have a trash can so you can clean your car out while you charge if you’d like."
"No issues, would recommend."
No issues.  Got my electrons.
No issues.  Quick n and out.
No lobbies of restaurants open.   Had to walk 10 minutes each way to get to a bathroom.   Will not use it again
No more going to Tannersville for charging. This location is so convenient with 12 stalls and a big Wawa attached. Plus curbside delivery if you are too lazy to walk the 100ft to the store.
No nearby bathrooms. Walking distance to McDonald's.
"No one else there, went into the gas station and used the bathroom, it was clean, and got a fountain drink, threw away thrash at trash can near the gas tanks, then laid back and chilled a bit and made it to Little Rock with plenty of battery to spare 💎🙌🌎💛"
No one there when I arrived.
"No one was there at this desolate spot.  Except for a couple living out of a Subaru. People must be scared to head north without a certified supercharger site. Too bad.  Don’t know why these places are close to Shell stations. They have gross food to purchase, are cramped and not fun to ask to use restroom. Of course the service is always nice."
No other cars at 10:00 PM. Next to a 24 hour grocery store with bathrooms.
No other cars here. People in the Wawa are nice as well.
"No other EV manufacturer has a charging network as tightly integrated as Tesla. The car preconditions the battery for the fastest charging time and it automatically calculates  how long you need to charge before leaving for your next destination.  If you buy anything else you'll be hunting for chargers, trying to validate your account to enable charging and doing your own calculations about how long you'll need to charge. Save yourself the aggravation."
"No parking charges here, and same price off peak and on peak hours, currently 0.27 cents per kWh."
No place like home
No power supply at this destination charger and no enforcement of ICE cars in spaces marked for EV
No Power! Don't advertise unless you are ready to serve customers.
No power.
No problem with the chargers themselves. Just need more chargers here. This is a stop most people have to use because they can't get from colby to selina in one charge (199 miles) especially in the winter. This is the only stop in between. Yesterday there were about 10 people waiting to charge here. 6 stalls isn't enough here. really need those 250kw level 3 chargers.
No problems and fully stocked restroom was a pleasant surprise.
"No problems except for the ICE vehicles parked at the station. Glad there was still room to charge. Update: I returned this evening to find all but one station blocked with ICE vehicles. The other station was blocked by a silver model 3 that wasn't even charging. I went back out the next morning and was able to charge.  I'm changing my review back up... the problem isn't the charger, it worked fine.  The problem is between the two hotels they are short nearly 50 parking spots for the number of rooms they have."
No problems. Thank you so much!
No public charger at this location.
No recharge stations here
"No restroom, mostly full. But does the job."
"No restrooms or ANY other services if you're here after hours, sketchy ""backside"" of the shopping center and great view of all the dumpsters."
"No sidewalk nearby for walks while charging during a road trip, but there were some nice wild flowers in bloom. A little bit busy when we visited; 7 out of the 8 charge stations were in use during our charge session."
No signs. We found a security guard that gave us directions. The yellow Section L M are on all 3 floors go to the bottom
"No supercharger. Only two chargers available, one of which is a Tesla 60 amp charger."
No Tesla charger here
No Tesla chargers 🔌
No waiting time. Charge and relax
No waiting! Though pretty popular.
"No washrooms. Petro washrooms across the street closed due to ""vandalism"", washrooms at general store beside Petro for customers only. Washrooms a few hundred yards west at visitor centre."
No!
"Nobody here would let me use the bathroom. I had to walk to the coffee shop up the street. Lightning doesn't strike 3 times, and 3 stores in different plazas next to each other don't all have totality different reasons for bathroom closures. Tesla needs to clarify to these scumbags that the PUBLIC permit means the PUBLIC bathroom is part of the deal."
"Nobody there at 11:30am. Three cars showed up ten minutes later.  I left at 12:30pm.  There were seven open spaces.  Easy in, easy out."
Non electric vehicle parked in Tesla only spot
None of the pumps were working when we pulled in today! Not sure if it’s an exception!
None of them worked! No one in Sheetz knew anything about them!
None of These work !!!!!! ☹️😩😡😡😡😭😢😢😢
Normally a good place to charge. But when they service the parking lot they don't block off the gas pumps but they block off the supercharger. Apparently Tesla drivers don't matter as much.
"normally great
only 4 bays available
currently solo gettting 39kw."
Normally no wait. There are bathrooms and snacks in the hotel. There are doors on the west side near the super charger where you can get in bathrooms just to the right coffee if it's open on the left
Normally not crowded. And 12 bays
North bound super charger. One of my favorite. Up to 300kW. Convenient location w lots of food.
Not 250 kW.  Currently charging at 37kw.
Not 250kW! Max output today 11/18/22 was only 150kW on the nose. 2018 M3P with SOC at 10% when I arrived. Stayed exactly at 150kW all the way up past 50%. No one else pulling from the stack.
"Not 250kw. Tried all stalls, best it got to was 100kw."
"Not a bad place for a charging station it it fills up quickly and you will end up sharing a stall dropping the charge rate by half. On the positive side, there are a ton of places to shop and eat so worth the extra time."
Not a bad place on NJ Turnpike for supercharging your Tesla.
Not a bad stop. 3 or 4 choices for food. Bathrooms though not the cleanest. Good enough for a 20 minute charge.
"Not a charger, they don’t let you charge unless you’re staying there!"
"Not a great location, chargers all work. Not much in terms of amenities. There is a hotel and restaurant close by. Hours are a little iffy."
Not a great stop.  Only porta potties. Both times I have been here the mall was closed.  No food unless you order and have it delivered or walk to something.
Not a huge fan of the intersections leading here during rush hour but got here fine. Currently pulling 112 kw so plenty of speed.
Not a lot nearby. Seems safe enough though.
Not a lot of people know about this charging station and it's not visible from the road and a paper mill to boot. There is another station less the a mile from this one at the Hampton inn and suites downtown parking lot.
Not a lot of stalls and not much around. Just one small gas station that is not that clean. But chargers worked fine.
"Not a lot of stalls, also sucks when one car is taking up two spaces during a busy Sunday... The FlyingJ has nice restrooms and convenience store selection. If too packed to charge, quartzite chargers are not too far and have a ton more!"
Not a public charger. Tesla nav took us to the garage. Charger is located in front of the Marriott hotel with valet.
"Not a real 250 KW, charging maximum at 150 and going down. This is the reason why the place is empty"
"Not a real charger, its pert of a property."
Not a real charging station...
Not a supercharger
Not a supercharger.
"NOT a Tesla charge, but an EV"
Not a Tesla charging station
Not a Tesla destination charger.
"NOT a Tesla Destination Charger. It’s a pay-to-use Chargepoint charger now. Instead of petering about, getting breakfast or shopping, we pressed on right away."
Not a V3 (250kW) charge station but you can almost always find a charge-staion pair that's not occpied so you get the fastest possible charge.
Not a very good charging station.  It is behind the hotel.  At night it’s dark and it’s a walk to the bathroom.  It’s a little confusing to get too from the freeway but just keep going by the slower ev tesla chargers then you will see fast super chargers.  It is safe to go to in the day if your a Tesla diva but I wouldn’t charge up alone.  I usually have to come to this super charger if I’m driving to Jackson but now they opened up one in the area so I may not need to come back as often.  I will be reviewing the Jackson supercharger as well.
"Not actually 250kw speed, only 150 max, and consistently only pulls "
Not all the charges work - but one of them did for us and it was a life saver!
"Not an entirely healthy supercharger station. 3A did not work at all when I was here and 2A was only charging at 72 kW. Finally, on the third move to charger one, I got 146 kW."
"Not an obvious charger, but easy to access and provided a great boost."
Not any convenience bathrooms or places to go nearby. A bit more isolated than most superchargers I've been to. Easy to find right off the highway. Area is well lit for charging at night.
Not as busy as other locations in the area. Only problem is the restaurant is located across the street. Great location for bathrooms at the local pump or grocery store. There is only one restaurant on this side.
Not as busy as some other Supercharging stations. The gas station store is well stocked so that helps as well
Not as fast as some super chargers. Easy access to restrooms inside Embassy Suites- door closest to chargers into Rocky River/Caffeina’s is close to restrooms. Would be nice if there was a trash can anywhere near chargers or backside of hotel even.
Not bad
"Not bad for my first charging experience. I did have a homeless guy come around and was asking for money, fast charge as they claimed."
Not bad. 10 +/- charging stations
Not bad. Good spot. Steady rates. Barnes N nobles right next door.
Not busy at all mid morning. Sunday afternoon busy. I got the last space.
"Not busy during my visit mid day on a Friday. Clean Kum n Go facility with quick service and wide range of snacks, drinks and mini convenient store grill."
"Not busy, right at a Sheetz, and some trees to provide shade for a picnic while you wait for charge."
Not crowded. Conveniently located in Meijer parking lot so great for a quick Shopping trip while car gets charged
Not easy to use restrooms in holiday inn. Have to wait for front desk person to give a code for restroom. Very rude people. Deliberately make you wait as we are not the ‘guests in the hotel’
Not enough charging stations
"Not far from my friend's so I can pop over for a quick top up between things. Like all Tesla Supercharger Stations, it is convenient to several eating and shopping choices. (Though I read while charging instead of either of the above. It was late and I wasn't hungry.)

Still quick and easy, no issues with the chargers."
Not far from the interstate at the Wawa gas station. I was there around 6 pm on a weekday and there was no one. McDonald’s next door. I was there only for 20 mins and was able to make it home. Spacious.
"Not far off the freeway and located near a BP gas station / Arby's as well as Starbucks. In fact, there was a lot of car traffic to the starbucks drive through passing in front of the charging area.

Great chargers, the newer 250KWH.

Used on 6/23/2022 about 3:30pm.  Arrived with 1 of 8 chargers in use. Initial charge rate was 215kwh and dropped as the battery filled. Charged our M3 long range from 34% to 80% in 26 minutes.

Used again on 6/27/2022 about 11:15am.  Arrived with 0 of 8 chargers in use. Charged our M3LR from 25% to 85% in 26 minutes."
"Not for public use. Registered guests only.
Opinion: don't register destination chargers via Google unless they are available in some way to the public."
Not found at this point. There is a municipal charging point at the next parking lot. It is required to download an APP. The speed is like 20mi/hour. At least it is working. It enables the standard version model 3 travel around White Sand National Park. Hope this review help you find the charging spot.
Not impressed!! 250 miles charge per hour. Not good for a 250 KW charger!!!!! That’s really slow as in about 100 kw slow! I was in slot A with nobody else using It either. Terrible……
Not in service
Not labeled A/B seems each slot is it’s own super charger connection. So my attached photo was taken wondering why the next Tesla to drive up would park right beside me.  Nice to see they are upgrading these.
"Not located where Tesla will direct you! NOTE: These chargers are around the back of the mall, NOT on the highway side. More towards the train tracks. In front of Lord & Taylor and At Home."
Not many food / store options nearby. Didn’t feel like a very safe area.
"Not many stalls, but super fast, didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes."
Not much around here but it was a quiet and safe location.
Not much around if you're here at night. Most everything around is closed. A bit of a walk is gas station that's still open if you have to go to the bathroom.
Not much around to eat in evening. Lots of loud cars racing through lot.
Not much going on at the strip mall here in January. I visited 3 times during our stay. It’s only a 125 kW station so preconditioning will help shorten charging times.
"Not much going on, but the Sheriff seems to patrol which is nice."
"Not much here but the main thing is it charged us up to continue our journey! No bathroom or stores nearby. Parking is kinda weird. You have to pull in more than I like so be aware not to mess up your bumper- overall a B score. Would only come if needed, else I would pass this one. We came from Seacrest Florida where there are no other superchargers other than Panama City Beach."
Not much here unless you need hearing aids or a supermarket. There's a Walgreens too
"Not much nearby, just the hotel.  Difficult to use many of the spaces in the winter because the snow is not cleared."
Not much options for vegetarians around this supercharger …Chick-fil-A and startbucks and a sabbaro pizza Are the only options nearby to the charging station…but if you crossing NJ this is one of the hotspots there are hikes also nearby if you want to visit that…
Not much to review. It charges my car. Does it fast. Haven’t died yet from electrocution but when I do I’ll let everyone know
Not my favorite hotel. . And location.
Not my favorite stop between Atlanta and Tampa. Given the other shopping centers in the area I wished they would have picked a different location. I got there around 5am and there were no restrooms nearby.
"Not my favorite stop to charge but it’s very convenient off i25 so I come here often. Warning*** there is nothing near the chargers as far as food or restrooms. There are plenty of stalls and never seen it crowded and I typically get 250kw. Also this site is a fixed higher rate to charge, not a surprised because of its location."
Not near hwy unless you want to discover the town. Gas bar lady is very friendly.
Not no damn supercharger. I specifically searched SUPERcharger
Not on/working and the staff didn't know/care about it.
Not open to public
Not plowed. Exxon across the street is responsible and hasn't bothered to keep this lot maintained. Reported to Tesla. Very disappointed.
"Not properly maintained in winter, the plow ""forgot"" about this location  or simply didnt care. Only 2 stalls are available for charging (out of 8), one is iced, and the rest are either blocked by the snow or out of order. Some people came with showels only to uncover a broken supercharger.  As a result - long waiting times, 40+ min (4cars waiting for 2 stalls) Panera bread is right there, so once you get to the charger, you can go inside to warm up. There is another suoercharger nearby, not sure if it is properly maintained."
Not public so stingy
"Not so great in winter. This station needs a roof or better snow removal service. Two chargers were inaccessible while buried in snow and ice (real ice, not ICEd ;-). Charge expectedly reduced dues to cold. I got only 98 miles/hr at best at 1B with no one at 1A (snowed in. See pic). One to 3 cars waiting to charge while I was there for 50 min. One charger was broken. I called Tesla and repair was already scheduled but not before a week later."
Not sure if new tesla owners but many park on the wrong side. People are pulling the plugs over the median so available slots messed up. But fast charging!
Not sure if this is a safety concern. I finished charging around 10pm and the sprinkler behind the charger started. Water was sprayed onto the charger handle and my vehicle. I hesitated for a second if I should touch the handle. Fortunately nothing bad happened and I am still alive. But I do think there should be some requirement on the distance between sprinkler and charger.
Not sure this is still here. I looked for it at the location on Google maps and there is nothing electricity related in that spot.  Perhaps the location is incorrect. I don't actually have a Tesla so I didn't look that hard.
"Not sure what the bad reviews are about, everything seems to work as it should for me. Only one here at 5 in the afternoon, and parked in the shade of a tree. 5🌟"
Not sure why but anytime I try to charge later at night here I’m getting 40-45kw max. During the day it’s peaked at 150kw but I’ve never seen close to the 250kw the Tesla app shows.  I’ve been the only car here every time and I’ve tried multiple plugs.. same result for all of them.
"Not sure why my car tried skip this charger for Gettysburg. Since we stopped at Cracker Barrel, this was right nearby.

Cheaper than Gettysburg charger.

Right next to the Sheetz.

Area was well maintained."
"Not sure why people are giving such bad reviews for no bathrooms. They're fast chargers, wide open and there's a grocery/pharmacy called Hitchcocks right in the plaza. They have public bathrooms in there and you can grab snacks! Win win!"
"Not sure why the other reviews were poor. This place was great. There are two charging areas. One to the right of the main hotel entrance.  The other to the left. Each charging area has one Tesla destination charger and a non-Tesla one. Hotel is great, right next to the river if you want to stay over night. Good launching spot for Mesa Verde NP which is 58 mi to the West or 1hr 15min without traffic.

Charged at 48A on Model 3 LR AWD or about 35-38mi per hour."
"Not that fast of a station, but great easy off hwy and convenient location. Might be the most expensive supercharger (was for me lol) if you go into the casino to use the restrooms while charging."
Not that fast. Got here with 15% and only 193mi/hr and excellent spot with the mall. If you come after hours that's a different story though.
"Not the best charger, it is very slow when other cars are charging. Sort of hidden if you have not been to it before, but it is really close to the freeway."
Not the best location for a charger. Parking lot is too crowded. It was very crowded and there was a wait time with 15 to 20 minutes.
"Not the best location. Nothing good around, but does the job. In plaza with carwash."
"Not the best place to charge up during breakfast hours. Except for a gas station nearby there isn't much in terms of options for breakfast. All walkable food places around the stop open at 10.30am, the only other option is gas station food. The gas station that's walkable from the charging station is open 24hrs, that's good. Holiday Inn right next to the charging spot had no public restrooms I could find."
"Not the fastest charger. It was busy when we arrived towing a trailer and had to drop the trailer so we could charge. The space was very tight for maneuvering a trailer. We did visit Dave’s market and found it fantastic, making the stop worth the effort."
"Not the fastest chargers, but a few good options and clean bathrooms. We stopped in here this fall and they had cider donuts and cinnamon ice cream."
"Not the fastest station. It's really out in the middle of nowhere, no trash, no restrooms, no food. Just a few financial/mortgage/investment companies in the gigantic parking area. But in the hour I was here I saw no other people, so at least it's not busy. Easily gains a star if there was a coffee shop nearby."
"Not the most lovely area. We stopped here around dinner time and there weren't any chain-restaurants or anything. You can piece a meal together at the grocery store, or try the Vietnamese place. The decor is dingy, but the food was decent, portions were huge. Availability of bathrooms and basic necessities was fine."
"Not the nicest charger setup, and the area doesn't seem to be cleaned regularly"
"Not the V3 (250kw) but it is still the V2 (150kw).  This location used to be free for all cars but it does charge an average rate now.  In general a great location, several hotels around, lots of eating choices as well."
"not the worst not the best in terms of kW.
But again w a Texas Best BBQ inside STOP!!
Their bbq is the real deal and happy got a second taste after the Grapevine TX location/charge.

Steak & Shake - take a pass says my wife who went to the wrong counter to order!!"
"Not their fault, but only contains one out of 3 plugs currently in use for EVs / Hybrids in the U.S."
Not there
Not too busy. All chargers working. Convenient to shopping.
"Not too close to the highway but plenty of spots and places to wait in case its full. When no one is there it is really fast charging.

Mall closes at 9pm."
"Not too crowded midday Thursday. Lots of shopping and dining options, easy on/off the highway. Biggie Wine & Liquor next door has a great selection of beers at decent prices."
Not too crowded. Convenient location for our trips to family in PA.
"Not too far off interstate 90, no wait during our visit. Convenient access to a yummy sandwich shop, large supermarket with a bathroom, and a fast food restaurant."
Not too fast but the area is nice for walking around! Lots of non Tesla's tend to park here though at busy times.
Not typically a busy charge station. Covered in a free parking garage which is nice to evade the FL sun. Lots of little shops and places to eat within walking distance if you should choose. Cell service is so so
"Not usually busy, we grab a bite at McAlisters down the road."
"Not usually busy. Typically 1-2 here at a time.  Today was the first time I had to share a pair of charging stations.

This Sheetz is great and most of the time no one is blocking (""ice'ing"") the chargers."
"Not very close to interstate. As for the Food Lion-- make sure you have a valid drivers license, even if over 55 years old, for a wine purchase!"
Not very convenient as there’s nothing in the area.  Also my vehicle is only charging at 73 KWh. Plan on spending twice the time here. Tesla seems like a great car until you buy one.
"Not very convenient to I-80 and only 4 stalls available, though lots of restaurants nearby.  Note that this is considered a high usage supercharger and charge limit is automatically reduced to 80%."
Not very much to do around. But I'm glad I went to the hotel located right in front the location. Clean restrooms. Nice restaurant. And a mini snack area. And lots of room to cool off and stretch out.
Not visible from Hwy 158 or when pulling into in. Go all the way back to grocery store. Hidden in front right corner of Harris Teeter grocery behind a row of dense juniper bushes. All back-in sites right off main parking lot entrance so awkward to block traffic backing in!
Not working
Not working !
"Not, busy and Starbucks in Harris Teeter close by."
"Note that while there are 8 stalls, they are paired in 2 groups of 4. So, if 2 cars are charging in one of the groups of 4, the power to those cars is cut in 1/2.

Clean location. Station has average selection of snacks and drinks and clean restrooms.

However, I have to come to Evansville from Indianapolis often and this is a game changer for my visits here.  The Evansville area is SO backward - they have at most Level 2 chargers anywhere in the city. It has always been true that it is like in a 5 yr time warp behind most place in the country. For all Tesla's traveling between Louisville and St. Louis there have been no places to charge, requiring difficult and time consuming routing."
"Note: while this is a Tesla destination charging station, it is a courtesy for hotel guests. You will need to purchase a stay at the hotel to charge. I paid to stay. Only fair. The hotel is quiet. Clean. And there is a Waffle House in the parking lot. I repeat, THERE IS A W AFFLE HOUSE IN THE PARKING LOT!  I mean c'mon for that, it's a steal!

So, vegan yoga pants wearing yuppies be kind, it's a family owned business just trying their best to be accommodating of all their guests.

Enjoyed my stay!"
"Nothing around it except for a bar, which doesn't open until 11AM, and a hotel. No public restrooms available anywhere nearby either. Avoid unless you really need to stop here. Prepare to be bored."
"Nothing but a gas station and a hotel nearby and Waffle House across the hwy. All the ok restaurants are on the (East) other side of I-95.
There's a wasp making a home at this charger! Haha"
Nothing is better than getting gas in about 2 minutes instead of 30.
"Nothing like owning a tesla, being electric is just amazing, supercharger charge my car in less than 30 mins, just WOW, that's faster than my phone."
Nothing open after dark for a nearby restroom or snacks. Just make plans to go to store on corner. Other than that. No issues. Daytime Biz hours can go into restroom in one of the stores in shopping center
Nothing open at night and far from freeway so wouldn't recommend for stop on road trip.
"Nothing super special. Pleeeeenty of stalls. I stoped by on a Sunday early afternoon and was the only one there. There are some train tracks and some cool looking rusting train cars/parts that are great for exploring while you wait. If I had my kid with me he would have totally loved it. It was also very shaded, which is always a plus when the stalls don't have coverings and are just exposed."
Nothing to do at night. Even the McDonald’s is closed. Area well lit so I could see the dumpster clearly. No wonder Elvis left.
"Nothing wrong with the charging station. But the museum restroom is locked and the Hotel(First Choice Inn) says Tesla hasn't paid their restroom for two years and thus we couldn't use their restroom. What's wrong with them? Even when I asked if we could pay for the restroom usage, they replied no. Disgusting. I would avoid the hotel as well as the charging station on my future trip."
"Noticed it didn't connect to ""Solar"" but the ""Electrical Green Box""... who's fooling who??"
Notoriously filled with ICE cars blocking the charging spots
"Now that Tesla autos are becoming more popular and there is a very active secondary market for them, the conditions at superchargers need to be addressed before they become a serious problem.  Until the pandemic is over, bathrooms need to be provided or the building nearest to them needs to have bathrooms open at all times.  Carl's Junior used to provide these services, but closed their lobby for the pandemic.  This needs to be addressed for Tesla users.  This is a huge issue and cannot go unaddressed for much longer before it starts to become a public health issue.  The second, connected issue is trash.  Even if you buy food from Carl's Junior, they do not have trash cans you can use.  This causes some people to feel free to throw their trash in the ground in and around the superchargers, giving them a very second rate feeling.  Tesla could easily address these issues by reminding CJ's how much money they make off of Tesla owners and to give some back by re-opening their restrooms for Tesla owners and providing trash services for Tesla owners.  It's not cool at all that CJ's has taken this stance, given how many superchargers are near CJ restaurants."
"Now, I need to buy an Electric Vehicle. I hope more station at more locations and lower EV cost would be ideal. Time will tell."
Nowhere near 250kW. Got 191kW at 16% SOC. Bathrooms at the Wendy’s out front need cleaning.
"Number 1A and 1B didn't work.   I was getting pretty nervous because I didn't have enough charge to get anywhere else,  but I finally plugged in to 3A and it is working. no amenities other than the love station which is a little walk"
"Obviously it is a slow charger, but we were forced to use it due to a 240 mile detour off of I-70 because of a semi truck rollover. It worked fine for the rating, but it would be nice if they added some v2 or v3 chargers to speed things up."
Ocean Resort Casino valet staff said they do Not have a charging station.
"Odd layout for charging (front to back chargers) but still works. Not the fastest speed, though."
"Of course this is a five star review. It’s the only Tesla supercharger in Puerto Rico and may be the only one for a very, very long time. The infrastructure in Puerto Rico does not support this level of charging. I am surprised that they were even able to get it to work here."
Of the main road a little bit.  Two lights for at night (assuming they fixed one).  Local grocery store nearby has good deli and fresh food selections.
"Of the two chargers in Center city, this is the best one. I would say if your in need of a quick charge come here. Their is the $5 garage fee but the kWh rate is generally cheaper for less an hour. You can shop at Target or DGx for groceries or grab a quick bit.

It’s not overcrowded like Penrose , and never had to wait in line. Nice people too. As long as rates don’t go up, I come here."
"Off the beaten path, and new 250 kW v3 chargers, so you are never going to be waiting.  The Wawa is it is located in is new."
"Off the highway and not busy at all.  The Sheetz is next door with lots of snack, food, and coffee options."
Off-peak prices have increased more than 50% at most Bay Area Superchargers. There is no longer any incentive to charge when it has less of an impact to the grid. Elon must need every last cent towards the next earnings call.
OK but had to walk all the way around the hotel to get inside to use the bathroom. No food close by.  Otherwise fine
"Ok charger, a little hard to find (behind the hotel). Food nearby is a Starbucks, a Sports Bar (decent food, but closed Monday and Tuesday), The Turn Club, and a block west, Avor Thai, an excellent little Thai restaurant just on the other side of Commonwealth."
Ok charging station at a great location. Was capped at 60kw with 10% battery.  I see only 4/8 were using it.  A market near by and a several restaurants. A must stop for a trip to mammoth mountain.
"Ok I give this a 5 star for the charger but I give it a 3 🌟 for the area its around, not much to eat or do. But great area to hangout for a quick charge."
"Ok location, far from shopping areas or a coffee shop. Lots of non tesla cars parked in tesla spots. Not cool."
"Ok place to charge(not so clean, but thankful it’s here!). Word of warning, be sure you take a needed potty break ahead of time if it’s Monday or Tuesday…the Interurban Restaurant is only open Wednesday-Sun(check for hours) and Freddy’s lobby is often “temporarily closed”🥺 The flooring outlet close by wont let you use their restrooms. I did find the friendly Toyota dealership has nice clean restrooms you can use(again, check hours tho)  Happy travels!"
"Ok supercharger station in parking lot of Comfort Inn, but not terribly fast. Only food nearby is McDonalds."
"Ok supercharger stop. Snacks and bathrooms available. If you are walking a dog be careful as there are spiky weeds and other hazards. Not a great stop for dogs, but the chargers are good."
"Ok, 3a wasn't working well for me. It stopped charging several times. Even after unplug and replug. Tried another and it was fine. Got 145kw. Pretty busy. Bathroom is in basement of hotel btw."
"Ok. It would be nicer if it was faster for sure.  several fast food places nearby, nothing I would like to eat at.  One of the chargers looks like it was damaged by someone.  Seems like more trash then what I noticed at other charges today.  The restrooms at the Shilo inn was locked. It looked like you needed a hotel keycard to get in, I was able to get an employee to let me in though. The restrooms were not very nice, but worked."
"Ok. No restrooms, no trash cans. Area is nice enough."
OK. The cons are the same that everyone else points out. Actual location is hard to find off of HWY 41 in Oakhurst. Charging speeds vary. Here's why I give it 5 stars 🌟: it's in Oakhurst on highway 41 between Fresno and Yosemite and close to Bass lake. There still is the Fish Camp superchargers closer to Yosemite but the Tesla supercharger network keeps expanding to rural areas and are popping up in more areas than any other EV charging network including places like Oakhurst. 5 stars just for putting a supercharger in a location I never thought I would see one in 😁👍. Now where are all the other EV DC fast chargers for non-Teslas? Gotta catch up other companies 😉
Okay location but only one restaurant which is part of the Double Tree Hotel. The chargers are sponsored by the hotel. It appears that the cost of charging may be with a premium as it cost substantially higher than other Tesla super charging stations
okay location during day close to city BBQ and other amenities. If night you will have difficulty finding anything open or restrooms
Okay location. Only thing around is a Meijer.
Okay supercharger. Only 150kW. Only LTE data on att. So you won’t get much use out of the car display or your phone if you use att. Not much to do while you charge. Not too far but kind of far from the nearest bathroom. Wish they would put more of these near convenience stores.
"Old chargers but working fine, a little far out of town but it's a nice walk along the waterfront and back while the batteries recharge for free."
"Older charger so the units share power in pairs. If possible charge at a number that no one else is at. For instance, if someone is at 2B don't use 2A as it will take twice as long for each of you to charge. Go to whichever number doesn't have some at either paired stall"
omg so convenient
"On 1/24/2023, my wife went to this charger and all stalls were down.  She attempted to drive to another supercharger, but ran out of charge and had to get towed.  She is furious at me for buying a Tesla and furious at Tesla for routing her to a broken charging station."
"On 24/7. One charger has higher KWh than the other. I took the smaller one since my 2015 Model S can't charge faster with the higher KWh. Did not have to check in, but I was a guest of the hotel. The rated 11 KWh was not what I was getting, I got 8 KWh, the voltage was low thats why. Did not test the 16 KWh plug."
On 2nd floor of garage where Michael's is. Very convenient and worth it
On 2nd level in South shore parking parking near sears entrance.
"On a long run and stopped here to charge. Lots of charging bays, clean restrooms in the gas station."
On a more candid note I was blown away when I visited Connecticut Post Mall and decided to go take a look this Tesla Supercharger station. This is not what we see in Africa all the time. It was amazing just looking at the rolls of the superchargers.
"On a road trip. Pretty fast charger, but tapered off (as expected) when other Tesla's plugged in. Cute little burger joint to grab a coffee or snack, too. Restaurant was friendly enough when we just wanted to use the restroom too."
On a side street off of Thames Street. No Superchargers in Newport!?
On April 20th at 12:30 AM I drove to Dadeland Station and the entry to the 2nd floor was blocked with 2 huge white barracades. No space to maneuver my Model 3.  I asked 2 custodians why the 2nd floor entry to the Tesla charger was block. I needed with urgency. They told me all the power is shut off every night.  I told them is supposed to be 24 hours. They told me to leave. I had only 13 miles. Is it because the gasoline shortage is having during this week.  No starts!  I gave one so I can post the complain. My friend helped me charged at her home. The website should have said CLOSED so I would have taken a different route to charge my car.
On Hilton Head Island! Nice!
On my way from Toronto to Virginia over the holidays we reached this supercharger based on the navigation direction in my 2018 model x 75D. We reached at a SoC of 9%. None of the chargers stalls were working. Tried all of them but nothing. After multiple chats and calls and hours with Tesla and they suggested third party chargers so went to the closest one available. (In the meantime Tesla has marked the supercharge as “under planned maintenance” for a week.) The ChargePoint charger we went to was a 7 kW charger. After another hour with Tesla to arrange a tow to a faster charger they mentioned that this has to be paid out of pocket and not covered by Tesla. When explained the fact that this was a problem with the supercharger and not the car they mentioned that it might happen that the supercharger would not work at times. Which basically means that the superchargers are unreliable as well and if you’re stuck like us get ready to spend out of your own pocket for a tow. Also after the tow even if you reach the next supercharger there is no guarantee that the super chargers will work. It might be in the same situation as this one ( while on the chat with Tesla they could see that 2 of the stalls were not working but all others were working which was clearly not the case when we reached. There was another model 3 which faced the same issue). Sorry for the long review but be careful specially if you’re traveling with family and small kids in winter.
"On our way from Irving,Tx to Hot springs national park. We juiced up our Tesla at this centre. It located in the Downtown of Sulphur springs which is famous for their glass restrooms 🚽in the square! Enjoyed walking around the small and beautifully decorated city downtown for Christmas. A nice place to grab food in one of the versatile restaurants around."
On the  side of Wawa gas station!
"On the side of Healthy Living, Trader Joe's across from there."
"On the south side of Indianapolis.  Not the most well lit of supercharger stations, but you pretty much have no choice but to stop here if you are driving to Louisville. (UPDATE! The East Southport station has opened since I posted this. Much better station!)

There's a tool warehouse behind the station and a hotel right next to it.  Not much else as far as walking distance attractions."
"On the way to Reno, we stopped to charge in Auburn. This bowling alley was clean, friendly, and welcoming! Would definitely stop by every chance we can"
On turnpike at service center. Was busy today but still really fast. Lots of bathrooms and food options.
"One cable missing, the other is broken  , they said a wire is pulled out.  8 May 2022"
"One charger not functioning, the other’s connector damaged. Not a viable charger"
One charger was out of order but not marked as such
One charger was out of service without any signage.
"One charger was out when I went but the rest were fine, close to the freeway, though exciting was awkward . Panda Express is a short walk away."
One did not work and had to wait for the others to be available for almost an hour. Common issue. Switching back to gas!
One doesn’t work
"One hour to charge from 20% to 90% which used to take less time before a software ""upgrade"" reduced it and the battery is degrading to fewer miles of range nearly everytime it charges. Originally 295 total miles, now it's 264 total miles and decreasing. 2018 Tesla Model X 100D purchased new and maintained exactly as Tesla requires and recommends."
"One in use, the other ICE'd but receptionist found owner and he was willing to move for us......then we woke up to it not having charged the car. It went out overnight and never came back on. The whole reason I picked this hotel was for that charger. Now I have to go to the Supercharger and waste an hour I don't have. Will be late to appointment now. Not happy."
One not working. One is but in use.
One of best superchargers I've charged at. When you're alone it actually delivers almost 250 kilowatt! Charging at about a thousand miles per hour. Awesome. Doesn't seem very busy either and a pretty good location. Sadly there aren't really restaurants around accept Wawa and like McDonald's within walking distance
One of my favorite charge locations
One of my favorite charge station spots. There is a Liquor Barn across the street along with several other retail spots.
"One of my favorite charging station, so serene!"
"One of my favorite super chargers. I love the bamboo trees surrounding the chargers and the friendly staff at the Hamptons Inn. There's a McDonald's a stones throw away, a Starbucks across the street, and a Chick FIL-A free blocks down."
"One of my favorite superchargers. There’s a gas station nearby, Starbucks, and a few restaurants."
One of my favorite vineyards in the area! Enjoy some wine and the Great view while you charge up your Tesla. Kid friendly with plenty of room for outdoor seating and a play area.
One of my favorites good shops to walk around.
"One of my least favorite charging stops. There's nothing wrong with the terminals, just the process of getting in and out is so painful. This is the intersection of multiple highways. Expect to spend about 15 minutes on top of your plan to stop sitting in traffic. Expect there to be a line for the bathroom. Expect for the parking lot to be so crowded that multiple charging slots are used by non-Tesla vehicles.

Protip- the lights to exit the sheetz have approximately a four-minute cycle. There's always a massive line to exit the gas station. Wait until the lights turn green and the entire queue clears out onto the street. Quickly get out of your car disconnect the charger and then pull forward and you'll be at the front of the queue. Exit the gas station in 4 minutes when the light next turns green. If you want to be really fancy proactively unplug your car, wait until the exit queue clears and then quickly pull onto the tail of the line to exit the gas station without waiting at all."
One of the best charging stations with close proximity to a variety of fast food and clean restrooms. The facility is well maintained
One of the best locations I’ve been to. Plenty of food and shopping options.
One of the best places ever I mean I really go there all the time tracking my test to let you know I got many tests I'm doing big things and bonsall growers association
"One of the best supercharger stops for dogs. Nice area with shade trees and places to sit. Great bathrooms in the Americinn, and wifi from the nearby days inn. One of my favorite stops for me and my dog."
"One of the best Tesla chargers in the area always an open space and easy shopping at Target.

There's also plenty of restaurant options and a park that is down the hill and to the left"
One of the better locations
"One of the better superchargers. V3 250 KWh install, has windshield washer squeegees, and is located at a large travel plaza with good food options."
one of the biggest superchargers around
One of the busiest charging around Indy. It limits you to charge upto 80 % due to heavy footfall. Overall maintained and I have not seen many out of order chargers here.
"One of the busiest Superchargers. They even cap your charging to 80% due to high demands.

Parking in this diagonal slots is sometimes a challenge for few, have seen them bumping into the charger. The opp end of the charger is a regular mall parking which is full making it difficult to go reverse to this charger.

There are few level 2 chargers as well in case you are here for shopping and not in a hurry to leave!

Hope they setup one in this area to ease the demands."
"One of the chargers was not working and had to move. Also, there was absolutely no shade at the time we charged. A few small improvements like shade and a stall status would make a big difference"
"One of the fastest chargers around, free (for me), and only 20 minutes from my cabin!"
"One of the fastest chargers I have been to. I got 1200miles per hour on a 10% battery.

It’s in an ok spot. Taco Bell and a food store are close by."
"One of the fastest superchargers we been to, the location is great there are restaurants everywhere we stopped by to charge our model X, had some great food and fun time with the whole family the only down side is the waiting line for the air pump is so close to the chargers that sometimes cars are in the way but not a big deal."
One of the first charging stations I've been to that has a trash can next to the chargers. There are also chargepoint chargers available. Close to the truck stop and truck museum with plenty to do
"One of the greatest super chargers I've been to. The solid yellow lines indicate the drivers to know where to park. Spacious feel but not too deserted giving it a great balance of nature vs nurture. I also enjoyed the surrounding views. To the north, a wondrous Meijer with bountiful goods, to the south, Mike's own car wash, where muddy cars go to clean. This Tesla Supercharger puts the super in supercharger."
One of the lower rate superchargers along the corridor from Tahoe to Bay Area. Only 150kw so would not be the top choice for those in a rush on the way - there are plenty of 250kw options nearby
"One of the more amenity filled superchargers I’ve seen. Restaurants (albeit fast food), hotels and a lovely little gas station with good bathrooms and plenty of things to look at/shop.

If traveling east on 70, it’s the exit soon after the big cross on the side of the road. If traveling west, you just missed it if you see the cross."
One of the most convenient locations in Plano. Very clean and easily accessible. This is my new place to charge my Tesla!!!
One of the most interesting layouts for a Supercharger location. It is a triangle and offers several options for charging. We were towing a trailer and we’re able to charge without unhooking. If it had been necessary to drop our trailer there was plenty of room.
"One of the nicer Supere Charger locations we have been to.
The Super Chargers in Wickenburg are located in the Old Town area with adequate parking after charging so you can explore the area on foot. Plenty of small shops and restaurants in the immediate area.
Public Restrooms are located in the City Buildings adjacent to the Super Chargers. The Lobby area and Restrooms are ""Open"" until 9:00 PM according to the Loancal Police department."
One of the two chargers is not working.  The one that is working is very slow charging (200 V).  They are Tesla chargers though so no adaptor needed if charging your Tesla.
"One of the two chargers was not operational (red light blinking 4 times), and the other charger was limited to 12A, about 3 KW charging speed."
"One of the two destination chargers had a sign saying it was “out of order”, and when we plugged the other one in, it didn’t work and when we tried to unplug it, part of the charger broke off and remained stuck in our charge port. It took about 20 minutes to dislodge it, and we were very disappointed.  There were ChargePoint chargers adjacent to the Tesla chargers but they were in use and given our experience we decided to forego charging at the hotel."
One of the valet people took my card info and bet on fandule with it hope it was worth it buddy
"One of the worst charging stations of Tesla. One to two chargers are always broken and 2 of the stations have charging speed of less than 30 miles per hour. Considering the city size Tesla should offer more stations and better speed. The average speed of charging is between 58-90 miles per hour (if you are luckky). We commute from San Diego to Phoenix quite frequently.  The estimate provided by Tesla Maps always turn out incorrect because charging at Yuma always takes more than 1 hour 30 mins compared to suggested charging time of 35 minutes. Please avoid long weekend. We once had to wait for more than 3 hours for our turn to charge and when we finally got our turn, the charging was available at 58 miles per hour which went down to 29 miles per hour. We had to sit there was more than 2.5 hours. There's nothing available closeby. The hotel next to the charging station keeps the door closed for Tesla customers ( may be their policy). We went looking for a restroom and nothing was available nearby. The most pathetic Tesla chargers I have seen so far. Tesla seriously need to upgraded these from 150 to 250kw"
"One pull through stall, 7 back in all seem to be working. I only saw peak of 72kW @ 220 mi/hr with no one else on.
Food options are decent, right behind Panera and Habit burger and close enough to Starbucks and in-n-out."
One side of the WaWa has V3 chargers and the other side has V2. Make sure you go to the V3 side if stalls are open there.
"One star for the location. Went on a Friday late evening to charge. The place looks unsafe. Got a few suspicious stares by people walking aimlessly. Also, there’s no nearby place to go and eat too. Would rather drive an extra 6-8 miles for a safer location than charge here."
"One station wasn't working and I didn't get 250kw.   One other car was there, but I was on 2 they were on 1."
"One station, located at entrance side of lot. It has two long cords. One Tesla (40amp circuit) and one non-Tesla. The cords would probably reach to the second stall. Convenient but pack a hobby. Or, Grab a coffee and/or a bite to eat.  I’d suggest charging enough to get safety arrive at next supercharger in route."
One Tesla charger had a broken charging wand and both spots were iced when I got there. Luckily the J1772 was working when I arrived and was able to reach a couple spots down.
"One Tesla Charger was not working and three out of the five chargers had no signs indicating that they were EV parking spots. Hotel staff didn’t seem motivated to take care of these issues. Plus, the three had shrubs that made it difficult to string the cables to the EVs."
"Only 1 charger available, but it works and is located in a great spot. Next to a shaded area with benches and a bathroom."
"Only 1 exit from my house! ....I've charged here now 4/5 times while renting Teslas. There are ten 150kW chargers. Never a line when I was there (at the most 1 or 2 other Teslas charging).

Took 20-30 minutes to charge up. One time it was an hour, but it was very cold, and even with pre-conditioning, the battery could only accept 35kW, then 52kW, but it got the job done. I took advantage of the nice amenities....

Friendly personnel. Super-clean facility. There's even a SubWay inside the Pilot station. The seating is ""coffeehouse-style"", with free WiFi ....Coffee, large convenience store, all kinds of snacks and beverages available. Burger King is steps away as well....

One of only 3 Superchargers in the Tucson area. The other major one, is at the other end of town, off I-10,  W. Orange Grove Road exit, at River Road (3844 W River Rd) 250kW (16 chargers)

The 3rd location is at the La Encantada shopping center 2905 E Skyline Dr ....Ten 72kW chargers"
"Only 1 HPWC at this locating, it is adjacent to a J-plug for a possible second connection if available. I was able to get 8kW (40A at ~200V).
The parking lot does say that the lot is for Marina permit holders only however I don't get the impression you'd be bothered if charging here and visiting the water front shops.

There's some good restaurants and a great little French bakery in walking distance."
Only 1 j1772 and does not work.
Only 1 of 2 Tesla chargers was working and the one that did was only charging at 2kw which means it would need 24hr+ to charge from 13% to 100%. Obviously didn’t stick around to charge there. Found a few other chargers nearby that worked better.
"Only 1 other vehicle, a model X. Currently charging at 137 kWh. Screaming fast!"
"Only 1 Tesla charger and 2 for Chargepiont. Close to some shops and a Panda Express. Slow charging at level 2 at 28mph. Only use if you don't have the 50 miles to make it to the next supercharger. Available to non guests of the Inn between noon and 8PM. See pic. Otherwise, stay in car to avoid getting towed..."
Only 1/2 of the chargers were serviceable.
Only 150kw and not by much food but at least it exists :)
Only 150kw charger but lots of food and shopping options within walking distance.  Small grassy area for pups is right in front of chargers.
Only 150kw charger I never saw above 75kwh even after I was the only car left charging.  Food and convenience store within walking distance.  Beautiful view and area to walk your pup.  Just slow.
"Only 2 spaces are Tesla only parking so some have been ICED.

2 stalls have been backed into. How does this happen anyway with all the sensors beeping at you?

Anyway, Wendy's sucks so just play frogger and go to Starbucks. Much better atmosphere and bathrooms are so much cleaner."
"Only 2 Tesla chargers, and 1 doesn’t work."
"Only 21kw charging , not what it states online"
Only 2kw which equals to 1.2 miles per hour. Plus all the regular cars park in the spots for EV’s so good luck. Nice place I would suggest you go for the great hotel not because of the chargers. No comment on the other EV chargers they were all blocked by normal cars so I don’t know if they are any better.
Only 3 functioning!  Uhhhhh
Only 32kW. I get the exact same speed at my house
"Only 4 120kW chargers at this location; on a mid-March Thursday afternoon, we were the only ones here. It seems you may be able to use the restrooms in the Marriott Towne Suites hotel. A good number of stores and restaurants nearby. This is one of the few Tesla chargers on 550 as we were traveling from Santa Fe NM."
"Only 4 charging stations, a little muddy around the area."
Only 4 stars because it is only a 150kw.  But not busy and sheetz is always a good pitstop.
Only 4 Tesla destination chargers. The other  2 chargers are non - Tesla - that can be used with adapters. Busy on the weekends. Many a time ICE vehicles are parked here that can make it challenging for EVs. On the plus side it is FREE
"Only 5 slots right in front of the Fairfield Inn.  Came here Sat noon and one of those slots was occupied by a non-tesla.  Including myself, was up to 5 teslas in line waiting to get charged..."
Only 50 kW
"Only 6 stations at 150 kW. Chevron is next door, where you can use the clean restrooms  which may be open until at least 11pm."
"Only 72 kW max, which always limits to 80% due to overcrowding. Vehicle mapping incorrectly reports broken stations as operable. No wifi for Theater. A long list of first-world problems. Really need more superchargers in SW."
"Only 8 stalls here and since this is a v2 supercharger you get only 72 kW is someone is sharing with you, not 150 kW. There need to be more here,  or upgraded to v3, as there were never less than 6 chargers in use while we were there."
"Only a couple others while I was there. Peaked at 235kw until I hit 40%, then tapered as expected. Only $0.24/kwh all day"
"Only accessible through valet.
I used a Tesla Tap to charge my Mach-e while vacationing and staying in New Orleans.
PS this hotel is terrific."
Only available to guests. Parking is not enforced so has cars were blocking both stations.
Only available to Hawthorn customers.
Only car there. Nice and fast 250kW!
Only car there. Started charging at 700+ mph.  Only 15 minutes to get over 100 miles on charge
"Only charged 70 kWh at the very beginning, even with preconditioning the battery, instead of the listed 250; this is due to the electric bank the chargers are connected to being 20-50ft away across the street and a row of parking in between as well. The closer the electric bank is to the superchargers, the more likely of the listed kWh being correct. Appreciated Whole Foods and REI being nearby."
"Only charged at about 80kW and the lot is in a bit of a sketchy area without many options to eat or drink. It's great to have a quick charging option in this area, but plan on staying in your car."
Only charges at 90 kw on average
"Only charges at max if 120kwh so be prepared to be a bit slower than most. Great location and near a few stores while you wait.
As always, ICE vehicles have no care and sometimes park at the chargers when there is plenty of parking at actual parking lot."
Only charges in College station! nice area and an H-E-B only a few 100ft away to shop whilst you charge!
"Only charging at 112kw. Thought this was supposed to be a 250kw charger. Tried 3 different chargers. 1B, 2A, 1A. 2016 Model S 90D."
Only charging at 20kw. 81mi/hr at 3 of the chargers. 4th time is a charm. 105 kw
"Only charging at 70kwh.. great station amenities once service station open, but charging speed is dissapointing as it says 120kwh max speed and we are one of 2 Tesla’s parked in the 12 stations, so not a capacity problem right now 😐"
Only couple of other cars charging. Right behind Lucille’s. We charged and decided to eat here. The diner is pretty decorative. Really friendly staff and pretty decent food.
Only down side is that this is the closest to the interstate and has the slow charging speed of 150KW. Shopping in the parking lot which is nice.
Only for hotel guests
Only getting 52 kw at this station. 3 cars charging
"Only got 40-50kW charging draw in new Tesla Y, not the 250kW advertised"
Only got 72Kw. 3B was hit and knocked off its base. Wendy’s is close and has great restrooms.
Only had 3 other cars 7 open stall when I arrived here at about 650am on a Thursday morning but within 10 minutes filled up and only had 1 spot open. It was fairly easy in and easy out. No damaged or non functioning chargers.
"Only my second time at a Supercharger. It worked out fine. Four other cars at an eight stall charger when I arrived. All others left before us. No issues. We visited some of the trails at the nearby  canal, ate lunch while charging and returned home."
Only one charger that doesn't work.
Only one charger working (and was being used by another Tesla). a reviewer on plugshare said this was an issue last Fall. Feel like hotel doesnt care enough to get it fixed. Wont stay here again.
"Only one charger working at the end of the parking lot. Station needs to be maintained. However, the idea of having this available is great, especially if staying at this hotel"
"Only one here mid afternoon, walkable distance to Sonic and Meijer."
Only one non-Tesla charger and it was already occupied when we arrived.
Only one of the two chargers works.
"Only one of two chargers appears to work (it’s possible both don’t, as someone else was plugged into the other one), area feels unsafe.  Do not recommend.   Florida, do better."
"Only one out of two worked, seemed poorly kept."
Only putting out 20kw... worked fine 3 days ago...
"Only supercharger I have seen in Maine, out of the way, never seen anyone using it but Maine not a major EV center. Maybe more use with tourist season."
Only Tesla charging here... not likely to have 12 Tesla drivers shopping at Winn Dixie all at once.  Could/should have been better installed to have a variety of options for other EV's as well.
Only Tesla destination charger available in Sierra Vista and only available to hotel guests.  Usually blocked by other non EV cars.
Only the 2 chargers at the end of the parking lot functioning
Open 24 hours. Moderate cost Beaufort hotel/restaurant and marina convenient store across the street. 10 kw power. Studying Map easy to find.
"Open as of Jan 2023, located in Meijer parking lot. Starbucks, DiBella’s subs, Chipotle are all walkable"
"Open but no lighting except for the chargers.

Absolutely NO OVERHEAD LIGHTING whatsoever at night.

I'm here at 1am so just watch your surroundings for crazy people."
Open location near a Subway and short walk to gas stations
Open space near Arby's. Newer gen chargers made for a quicker stop. No complaints.
"Opened in January ‘23, this station has 8 stalls. Located south of Eugene, this is a very convenient charging option directly off of I-5. I

t’s in the parking lot of a restaurant, which seemed to be packed, with mostly locals, on a Saturday morning.

Check out Creswell Bakery which is nearby. For very unique barrel aged beer, don’t miss Alesong Brewing & Blending’s scenic country brewery in Lorane (15 miles to the west)."
"opening very soon
as of october 19th. 2019
opened jan.2020"
Operating full ! get coffee while you super wawa !
"Operational, clean and safe location."
Order food from mall across the parking lot.  Some chargers appeared to be down.  Otherwise convenient location especially if staying at nearby hotel
"Other than one of the S being on fire, it was pretty great!"
Our favourite rural Saskatchewan Supercharger.
Our first time at a Tesla Supercharger and we were in and out in 20 minutes. Two other Teslas charging at the same time on a Saturday morning. Started charging at 500+ miles per hour and by the end was at 300 at 80%.
Our go-to charge station when coming back downstate.  Easy access behind Dougherty's and walking distance to all the businesses in downtown Clare.
Our goto Supercharge conveniently located by a Target and a set of nice eateries. On Saturdays you get a bonus with Farmer Market so one can take nice stroll when charging. There are nearly dozen stalls and in last several months didn’t face any issues charging (they had a few snags in 2019-2020 but it appears they fixed it thence).
"Our second time here today. We were on our way to Mt Washington, now heading home. We were happy that it’s at a Dunkin, but sadly if you arrive around 8:00 on a Saturday night they will be closed. Bummer. Gas station next door with restroom was sufficient, I guess. 🙃"
"Out back of a Costco/Stop and Shop, by the dumpsters.  Pretty far from 90, Down a road that is very badly in need of repair, no other humans in sight, even at dusk.  It got the job done, but next time I'll plan to avoid this one."
Out of order
"Out of service as of 6/17/21. According to the vineyard, the chargers have never worked since installation."
Out of service for how long?
"Out of the way if you're traveling on 64. There is a grassy lawn in the back and plenty of pebbled walking areas for pets. Good rest rooms in the hotel and aice shopping center adjacent where we picked up groceries and also and Outback Steakhouse for an evening meal. Here too, if you need a full charge, be sure your navigation system shows a distant location. First time through we didn't know that and were capped at an 80% charge, tricky to get to the Albuquerque (south) or Moab (northwest) chargers."
Output is 130 kW for a charge of 418 mi/hr. Lots room for more Tesla’s!!! I grabbed a quick 30min charge. 🥂
Outstanding for a V2 charger. The charge speeds are good. It is by a bunch of good restaurants and the Meijer grocery store for late night charging.  You have access to a restroom or picking up snacks or even groceries on the way to or from somewhere. There is also a garbage can and a washer fluid bucket with a windshield washer squeegee. It's one of my favorites for the V2 chargers. I can't wait until it's converted to V3.
Outstanding stop at visitor center with restroom and nice place to take a break.  Arrived at 14% and left with 80%... Was glad to see this place up and running!
Outstanding! 50 miles in just over 15 min! Quite impressive! Time to relax and recharge! Walk to eat BBQ or a burger 🍔! Great location for a super charger! Doesn't get better than this!
"Over all ready to find, the casino is open to use the restroom. Not the fastest charging station. We're the only one here tonight."
"OVER CROWDED! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I regret spending 40 minutes waiting for this charger. Every charger was working, but with only 6 stalls I should have charged before entering VA Beach."
"Over crowed with uber drivers, sitting there all day watching TV and when I was waiting another uber driver slid into the spot I was waiting for, I go from 0 to 100 really quick emotionally so I just left. This should be restricted from Uber drivers.

They should only be allowed to use regular charging stations and not overload the supercharger system for actual owners of Tesla vehicles.

Also, there should be a time limit or even pay to.ger inside the parking garage in order to use the chargers, that will stop them from coming in and they'll go to other stations that aren't Tesla owned and operated.

This is a must."
"Overall a great charging location, super convenient for I-25 and the gas station has Wendy's and good snack options.

One side note: right now there is construction on the south bound I-25 exit and there is almost no signage on where the detour is. Your best bet is to get on I-25 north and get off on the first exit about 2 miles down then cross the bridge and head south. It's absolutely absurd.

Why 3 stars?

Cons:
There is only one charger suitable for anyone that has anything hitch mounted (hitch rack or trailer). We had a hitch mounted carrier with an ice chest on it, and even backing all the way up against the chargers, the cable didn't reach. So our only options were: park sideways and block a bunch of stalls OR remove the hitch rack. Luckily when we got there nearly all the chargers were empty but right when we finished charging, literally about 8 Teslas pulled in and we looked like the most inconsiderate Tesla owners on the planet for about 5 mins.

Given how quickly stalls filled up, and the limited options for anything hitch mounted, they clearly need more stalls here."
"Overall very decent.

Very quick on/off 95, nj turnpike.

Google map is wrong, follow tesla nav. Enter garage at closest entryway from turnpike, make a u turn to LEFT in garage. Under Saks. Ground floor.

Free parking for 30min. I recommend NOT to go to the mall, resist at all costs as you will miss your 30min mark. It's big.

Took one star off for headache of going into garage and dealing with ticket system.

Also unclear where bathrooms are or where to buy a coca cola..."
"Overall, this is what makes Teslas an incredible vehicle. They're in complete integration is second to none!"
Owner blocks it with his model S. Should be removed as a destination charger.
Owner is DISRESPECTFUL go somewhere else
Owner tried to charge me $50 to charge and was incredibly rude about the whole situation.
Owners are very nice! Great charger!
"Owners very pleasant, fast L2 charging, we would have stayed at the Manor, didn't realise they are pet friendly, will stay there next trip up..  Close to many fast food restaurants."
"Paid $7 for parking where I was only able to charge 57 miles - in an hour! Technically in the first 20 minutes at 65kW, then dropped to 16kW and stayed there for 10-15 minutes and the rest of the hour at 1-2kW. What a waste of my time and money."
Paid valet parking required to access the charger. Restaurants in the area are either closed or super expensive. Wishing I'd chosen a different charger & and hotel.
"Palm Beach Outlet Mall Parking Lot, 3rd Sunday of every month.
Cars&Coffee 8AM- 12PM"
"Panera Bread was so busy they gave me a metal soup spoon for a “to go” order. Too funny. 🤣 Getting back on I-75 N was a bit time consuming, but I sure appreciate Tesla’s foresight in providing these super chargers conveniently. I was below 35%! 🥴"
Parked right in front of Smithfield's Chicken N' BAR-B-Q. Great place to eat while your Tesla is charging.
Parking garage the charger is in charger $12 on the weekends dont recommend
"Parking here is expensive, but if you dine at six.one.six inside the JW, they validate it."
"Parking is not a problem since its close to wall drug! Our dogs have small area to walk unless you go for a block. Not shaded area, so it can be hot during summer. And I like stopping there for ice creams! 😂"
Parking lot can be tricky to navigate but the local amenities are decent. Four fast food and chain restaurants within walking distance. The Target offers clean restrooms and a Starbucks if a quick pit stop is all you need.
"Parking lot is tiny for 5 story hotel. We arrived at 5pm & both Tesla & J1772 chargers were in use. Luckily we did not need to leave early, & I was able to charge following morning after others departed. Charger worked fine, thank you IHG for having one."
Parking lot now outdoor seating for restaurant. No access.
Parking operates from 6AM to 12AM.
Parking rate is $1 per hour. Just take a ticket when you enter the garage and pay on your way out. Super easy. There are 8 chargers. Other Tesla drivers using them have always been super friendly and helpful if you need any help or have questions.
"Part of the WaWa superchargers, so super convenient, good restrooms and food/drinks, half a mile from the interstate, Culver's is next door, which puts this spot over the top."
Passed by east Brunswick and found this charging station. Wow . It was empty . They had about 8 charging station and I was the only one using it . 250kw charger but it was in a wierd location.  Not cheap though. About 0.32$ per kWh. Of course it’s next to a Wawa ..:). Good charging location if closer to east Brunswick .
"Paul Tesla superchargers are convenient and easy, and this one is no exception"
"Paving blocked the entrances, but exiting was fine, really weird but the location isn't bad (I stopped on a trip off I-84, so it was out of the way, but needed a charge) swig and mo bettah nearby. But at night there isn't anything open"
"Peaceful location up on a hill, first spot I pulled into charged as it was supposed to, no complaints!"
Peak hour throttling. Not the best spot in the parking lot if you want to go into the grocery store to shop. But whatamigonnado?
"People staying at Oceanside Inn by Vacasa not only parked their Suburban in the Tesla Destination Charger spot, but they also shooed us away saying “this is a private party” when I walked in from the sidewalk with my family to investigate if we could use an EV charger."
"People will park trucks and trailers infront of all 8 chargers and then harass you when you ask them nicely to move. This is a consistent issue, and people need go be understanding that this is the equivalent to a gas pump and not start a dispute over it. Wawa does not enforce law, which makes it illegal for ICE cars to park in the stalls. Signs  are there."
"Per previous reviews, we charged at charger #1 which charged at 130kw. A brand new hotel just opened in the attached parking lot. Bathrooms were super clean. The Steak/Shake next door is open for drive through only — their service was slow and we realized  2/3rd of our order was either missing or incorrect. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"Per Tesla’s Nav system as of Nov 24th 2022. Cost is $0.35 per KWh. That’s “reasonable” compared to some other places today.

Update. Price increased to $0.40 per kWh. That’s a $5 increase for a 80% charge on a 78kwh battery."
Perfect
Perfect  location? Plenty to do. And I don't know how long this will be there but it sure is convenient lol
Perfect example of Tesla owners having access to high speed charging with room to spare.  As I waited for my ride. Because my cars serpentine belt broke; I watched 24 Teslas rotate and share the highspeed charging stations with zero incident.  Anyone who says this is more inconvenient than filling up their auto with gasoline does not know what they are talking about!
"Perfect experience yet again... how people oen non-Tesla EVs with slow Chargepoint and EAmerica is puzzling.

Just add trash bins and maybe a Cafe, lounge, restroom one day?!"
Perfect for charging and visiting restaurants in the area. (Parking for charging is $12 )
"Perfect for dogs!  This is a great, FAST supercharger stop!  The owner of the Landmark Travel Center loves dogs and has installed a dog run / park with fence and gate for traveling pups to get a stretch.  It's really a great stop and we will make it a point to stop there so the pups can get more than just a leash walk around while we charge.

We've never seen more than one or two other Teslas charging at once, so it's also fast.  The convenience store has clean restrooms and is well stocked with snacks and drinks.

On our most recent journey, we accidentally left our dogs' water bowl near the charger, and the staff went and secured it for us so we could get it back.  They are nice, compassionate, dog-loving people, and we love stopping here!  Thank you!"
Perfect for people staying at Oxford Suites. A bit of a walk to Walmart… but at least you will be charged up by the time you walk back.
Perfect if you're staying at the hotel where this is located. We made a weekend of it in Aspen and choose to stay at the Inn because the charger and we couldn't be more pleased!  We thought the charging would be slower with the urban charger but it was fast enough for us since we weren't in a hurry. Faster than my 220 at home but slower than the newest supercharger. No spots were being iced which was a plus considering the parking lot was pretty full and the spots were close to the side entrance.
"Perfect location
Target,starbucks,kfc,subway,att,chipotle,
Bestbuy, and so many more stores nearby at walking distance"
Perfect location and typically never crowded. All the stalls are in perfect working condition and provide optimal charging times when compared to other stations. Close to the main entrance and an ideal Meijer for a quick coffee or snack.
"Perfect location for a high traffic area. WalMart is within walking distance, several restaurants close."
Perfect location. Lightning fast.
Perfect location. Right across from Rusted Spoke Brewing. Great options for your short charging stay
"Perfect location. Starbucks, grocery store, pharmacy, A&W, and... a nice little liquor store."
Perfect place for safe charging! Located right out front of the Crescent Point Wickenheiser Centre!
"Perfect place to leave it charging while you shop, FYI if you leave a car in between your car will charge faster. 😉"
"Perfect place to stop and charge. An Irving, Applebees, and a Shaws all within walking distance, it’s easy to grab a quick bite to eat."
"Perfect place to stop on a road trip.  Perfectly functional chargers, clean, easy access, and the Sheets was perfectly nice."
Perfect spot at a sonic. 8 chargers so they are never full. And across the street from a nice frocery store with clean bathrooms if you need to stop!
Perfect spot at Destin.  Was concerned as it’s my first long drive and enjoyed the stay in Destin
"Perfect spot for a charge! Grocery store, restaurants, and shops in close proximity."
Perfect spot for meeting people on your way to Starbase! 🌎🚀🔴
Perfect spot for Supercharger!!! Right off the interstate and located at a nice big clean gas station.
Perfect spot! Quick charge and close to everything. Easy to get in and out from traffic. Close to a Sonic also.
"Perfect station with parking in the back right next to a food court. You will want to stop here during the daytime since all shops close in the evenings. There looks like there would be adequate night lighting, but no nighttime amenities."
"Perfect stop for anyone nearby Waco, Austin, and Corpus Christi. It's immediately off I-37 with a dog park, Love's gas station with an attached Subway and McDonald's. It has a total of 8 supercharger stations and fast food drive through."
"Perfect, and long awaited location! This supercharger is in a supermarket parking lot which is always convenient. There were two picnic tables recently, and other shopping and eating nearby."
"Perfect, super quick. 375mph at first and slowed down to about 275 as it filled up. In a Mellow Mushroom parking lot with Zaxby’s nearby and a big outlet mall (Tanger outlets) just a short walk away."
Perfect! I couldn't have gone much further! ;)
Perfect. Located beside Harris Teeter so I went shopping while Emthree sipped electrons!
Perfect. Some are not working but you will still be able to find a spot. Really close to a back door to the Hampton. Charging at 36 miles per hour.
Perfect😗👌
"Perfectly situated off of I-94 and pretty good charging speeds. 440 miles/hour currently.  I usually see around 270 on average when charging beyond 40%.

EDIT: Hit 500 mark today (May) :O"
"Personally, I hate reversing into the supercharger slots. I appreciate that this supercharger let's me pull in forward. And that it's typically not very busy, either!"
Phenomenal chargers. Very fast. Make sure to go inside the grocery store that shares a parking lot to stock up... You'll be surprised at the impressive selection and quality of this local grocer!
Picked up 50 miles per hour....nice benefit for coming out to  chestnut mt.....I'll be back for skiing when weather permits
"Picnic tables, trash can, walkable food. Smithfield’s chicken n bbq is 50 feet away.
250kw charger."
Picturesque charging station next to restaurants and shops
Piece of junk. Chevy Camaro is better. I bet the Mustang will out run it and last few years longer. But not to many cars around can beat my car except for the police 🚨.  I keep it in storage so I can keep my license. It's a ticket getter. All I have to do is back it out my garage and there just waiting for me to gas on it. Even my passed uncle Ford falcon is better. Go ahead and buy one. You will regret it.
Pilot truck stop with 8 Supercharger’s way in heck out here.
Pitiful.  Charging never got over 165 mi/hr.  Tried three stalls.  Never a car beside us.
Pizza and nice grocery store nearby!
"Pizza place across the street was fantastic.   Great value. And big portions.  We got Tuscan panini, eggplant parm and a huge pizza.  All while charging the car."
"Place is always busy, so that means your going to be charging longer then usual. The only good thing is, you can shop."
Place is always packed but in a good way. I wish there was a actually trash can to threw things away at instead of people threw it out on the grass.
Place is to the right around the circle about 200 yards and the building is on the right side of the road. There are three stalls.  it only charges at 48 A which gives me 45 miles per hr of charging
Place is very clean snd convenient.
"Place was alright, expected charge speed, few places to eat nearby. Gas station is about a 5 minute walk if you need drinks and snacks. Place is a tad bit too secluded from civilization."
"Planned to charge at mount rushmore, paid 10 and they are under construction and not able to charge. VERY annoying !"
"Pleasant spot with some shade, picnic tables, and the famous and wonderful Granzella's restaurant and deli right across the street.  The nicest supercharger location I know of."
Pleasant supercharger. Does not have off-hour rates.
"Pleasantly surprised to find a local cafe near the charger! Almost exclusively over the past 3 weeks traveling from charger to charger I’ve been disappointed to wait in a hotel parking lot or other plaza, nowhere near real food (I’m looking at you too Applebees). The drought ended today with the pleasant soup/sandwich and ice cream offerings at the delightful U Drop Inn cafe! Others have pointed out that there is an 24 hour outdoor restroom open if you happen to come when the cafe is closed. How nice! This type of experience is what I expected charging would be like but not so at other places. This place is the pleasant exception and not the rule. Usually one finds herself in a dirty parking lot without so much as a trash can. Thanks for doing it right, Shamrock!

I should probably mention that the charging seemed to be perfectly fine, but honestly it’s not the headline. Get some real food, rest a spell, and appreciate how clean everything is."
"Please be careful when charging at night. Tonight, there were two sketchy guys sitting in a black gas car parked directly at a supercharger. They stared the entire time while I was parking and every time I looked over, they tried to hide. I didn’t feel comfortable leaving the car but eventually, they drove across the street and watched from a distance. The parking lot was empty so they didn’t have a reason to park at the chargers. On the other hand, this location is great during the day."
Please do not charge your car here. The Sheraton Suites where the chargers are located will threaten to tow your car if you are not staying at the hotel. They also have no posted signs about this. They are very rude and just say it is private property. Telsa should warn others that their changing network they advertise about is not always accessible to the public.
"Please read the reviews the superchargers are in second floor of the garage, don't get confused like I did before😄,go in the west side of the garage and you'll find the entrance..."
"Please update this site, at minimum 150kw per stall not shared. Also awesome compared to lvl2 "
Plenty chargers available
Plenty of amenities. Winter charging with some pre conditioning 118 kWh. I arrive with a very low state of charge
Plenty of available stations that are all operable and charge at very quick rates. There is a gas station and Subway very close to pass time or use the restroom.
"Plenty of bathroom and shopping opportunities at these chargers located right off an I-5 exit in Kelso. Chargers are located in a parking lot shared by a Target, Panera Bread (chargers are closest to this restaurant) and Red Lobster. Safeway and other fast food in walking distance.

There’s a nice patch of green space behind the chargers if you have pups that need a bathroom break."
Plenty of chargers and a convenient location. The only drawback is that there is nothing nearby if you want to get snacks or find a restroom while charging.
"Plenty of chargers and they have charger spots for vehicles that are towing. Decent food choices just a short walk away. Clean bathrooms along with a good sized convenience store. If the chargers were also shaded, it’d be perfect, but it’s a great place to stop and charge as it is."
Plenty of chargers and this charger station is owned by Tesla and you can use your miles here if you have some in your account.
Plenty of chargers available on a Sunday afternoon.  They are right by the Wawa as well so you can just charge your car while you head into Wawa to grab a bit or have a bathroom break.
Plenty of chargers in a well lit area. Super charge available.
Plenty of chargers next to a Chevron. Short walking distance to casino and fast food chains.
"Plenty of chargers, tidy bathrooms. I love that this one is at a regular gas station; we actually saw an interaction where a curious person was asking about a Tesla. A win for the conversion to electric in my book."
Plenty of chargers. Close to freeway exits. Super easy to get off freeway and find off mall parking lot. I wouldn't want to use at night. Not very busy .
Plenty of chargers. Could use some lighting for night time.
Plenty of chargers. Lots of shopping & food choices
plenty of charging spaces and you can eat lunch while u wait
Plenty of charging stations but it doesn't feel like a safe environment
"Plenty of food options nearby (Subway, Waba Grill, Nekter, to name a few). The current row of 10 is sufficient but there could be a wait of 10-15 minutes during busy times. Pictured below are the new stalls! Should be really useful once in operation. Will be 5 stars soon!"
Plenty of green space for a puppy potty break. Walking distance to Burger King.
Plenty of level 3 chargers with no wait time (fingers crossed) as we charged the car a few times while staying at Cedar City (for Brian Head). Friday evening for a holiday weekend was about 70-80% full (but had open stalls) and 10 pm on Saturday night only had one or two other cars charging with me. Trash cans on site where the stalls are and there is a gas station for a quick bite and restrooms. However there are no restaurants or shopping center nearby of walking distance.
Plenty of new 250kW chargers.
"Plenty of open chargers around 7pm.  Only mild downside is it's in a parking deck with little close by. On a positive note though, it is in a parking deck so its shielded from the elements."
Plenty of open spots and plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Just wish it was 250kw instead of 150kw but I’ve never had a problem.
"Plenty of open stalls, love the new layout which allows you to drive right up.  Plenty of restaurant choices within walking distance.  I stop here quite often and love this charger."
Plenty of parking but spots were blocked by non-EVs. No signs for EV parking only—not that it’s hard to figure out what those spots are for.
Plenty of plugs available! I do with owners would stop leaving their trash. Maybe we plaza can put a trash receptacle out
"Plenty of restaurants to choose from, including24-hour sit down option - Denny’s. The hotel front desk is friendly and allows bathroom use. Good charger, 150 watt though, located in the back of the parking lot past hotel lobby."
Plenty of room and enough units there's never any waiting.  Pull in.  Hook up.   Go see the wildlife at the pond or theres also a dog walk. You can walk the trails with your pooch.
Plenty of room to charge your overpriced Tesla. Haha seriously they havs plenty and they are new
Plenty of room to navigate into the spots and plenty of things to do nearby while charging.
Plenty of shade. And close by. Two different charging stations.
Plenty of shopping and plenty of chargers.
Plenty of space to charge your tesla...❤
"Plenty of space when we visited on Saturday evening, lots of shopping / food options to visit while waiting, and the fastest charging speed I've experienced at any supercharger."
"Plenty of spaces were available. Left the car charging while my gf and I went to Marshall's to look at baby apparel because she's really obsessed with babies right now...I'm not too sure why but something tells me I have to be really careful these days, if you know what I mean."
"Plenty of spaces. But note that it’s 8kw, not 16 as Google Maps reporting now.

3 stalls in total, 2 Tesla + 1 J1772 for each stall. Just read the label: 60A total per stall. So don’t expect 16kw."
"Plenty of speed while traveling through.

Although it’s not V3 as stated (perhaps an error on UI or at the time of my visit?)"
"Plenty of spots. At a Sheetz, so you can grab a meal"
"Plenty of stalls arranged in a convenient way to enter/exit, right next door to the Pea Soup place in case you want to grab a quick bite while charging (but that's about the only thing nearby). Restaurant also useful if you need a biological pit stop while the Tesla is charging"
"Plenty of stalls great charging speeds.  Lots of choices to grab some good food nearby. It's right next to the High Roller, left of it actually.  There's also a Big City Bus Tour you take with open top that meets in that exact location."
Plenty of stalls here.... no complaints
"Plenty of stalls, clean, near and awesome diner joint M&O."
"Plenty of stalls, the trash wasn't overflowing and a Starbucks was nearby for easy refreshments and restroom usage."
Plenty of stalls.
"Plenty of stalls. In good working order. Not crowded at all.  Desk person at nearby hotel was so generous as to offer directions to restroom without my even asking.  She was very kind and helpful. Quite a hike to food and stuff, though."
"Plenty of stations, lots of great options within walking distance while you charge. If you’re looking for a great atmosphere and good glass of wine check out Dos Olivos across the street."
"Plenty of stations. Very fast charging. Not limited even though > half of stations occupied. Right next to (and probably sponsored by) a large complex of farm-themed restaurants, attractions, and a hotel. And corn fields."
"Plenty of stores and places for a quick bite while waiting. Within the same parking lot there is Sprouts, Tuesday Morning and Burger King and Taco Bell. Across is Walmart and McDonalds. And of course many more little stores in between. Plenty of time to shop while charging"
Plenty of super chargers at a convenient distance to a restaurant/coffee shop.
Plenty of superchargers right by the Fort Drum Service Station. The service station offers nice clean bathrooms and plenty of options for fast food and some shopping.
"Plenty of superchargers, bathrooms available in Tesla service center during open hours. Terrific cafe next door with indoor and outdoor seating, Hay J’s Bistro. Additional restaurants nearby as well."
"Plenty of Tesla chargers. However, besides multiple ice cars parked in front of them none of them functioned."
"Plenty of Tesla Supercharhers on Saturday late morning,, there available, out of the 10 total stations.
Superchatger will fully charge  from 10% to 100% in a hour or so,and for $20 filled (model 3).
Wawa is across the lot while waiting for charging to complete.
Convenient (kinda) about 3 miles from SR 56 at I-75 N/S intersection, on right at Wawa entrance."
"Plenty of V3 stalls here... Good shopping center close, and somewhat close to the freeway on off ramps...."
Plenty of working Tesla superchargers 24/7
"Plugged in with 1 hour and 20 minutes to charge.
Walked away and received notice in about 30 minutes that charge had stopped.
Penalty was waived (thank you) since it was not our lack of response.
We had navigated to and preconditioned the car but had a constant notice to do so next time.???
If you can't get stations operating please get the ccs adapter out so we don't have this stress!"
Poor location for road trips. Food is terrible… should have picked a location with a reasonable restaurant (not fast food)
"Poor Location.  The Superchargers are good but this is not a good place for them.  The restrooms are typical of run-down gas stations and kind of gross.  There is a Subway inside but a sign says they are temporarily closed.  So that leaves Tesla owners waiting to get into the bathroom and eating hot dogs on a roller or microwave burritos.  Not sure why Tesla picked this location.  It is one of the worst!  There's nothing else anywhere around the area.  But if you need some electrons, you have no choice."
"Poorly designed small lot located on the side of a Winn Dixie with 12 stations -always full.  No entry or exit with cues of 10 cars or more.  We stopped several times one day and every time 10 cars waiting in line. Note to travelers and 1st time Tesla drivers arriving in town: this is the only public station in New Orleans!!!  We finally came back around 8:15 on a Saturday and was the only car in line.  Lucky for us after 3 minutes we got our spot. When we left 30 minutes later a line of 8 cars were waiting.  Warning to out of town folks:  Do not go to the many designated destination chargers as they are all “private” chargers for hotel guests.  We stopped at a destination charger behind an Inn, plugged in and the unit had no power so a switch had to be turned on inside the property. We then drove to the city park near the golf course thinking this one was for the public but it is not."
"Popular and busy ""high-usage supercharger"" at least in mid August. Conveniently located at a Neon marketplace. Across the street from a sports pub. Adjacent to 195 on ramp. Felt perfectly safe charging here."
Popular spot to get a quick charge - had to wait about 20 minutes. Good spot to top up.
Possibly the slowest of chargers even with no other cars charging at any chargers.
posted 1/19/23  DISASTER.   2 of the chargers flat out don’t work.  look like they were driven over by irresponsible Tesla drivers.  the third one i tried attempted to worn and the people beside me we’re getting intermittent power.   My guess is something must be amiss w power source.   2.5 miles away is another bunch of chargers in a much better location and they worked fine
"Posting as info. At Sheetz. Restrooms at Sheetz. Easy walk to Burger King, Panera, Golden Corral. Checkers across street ( traffic light)"
Potential pump traffic could case problems backing in. There is a potential to charge with a trailer attached if the parking spots next to the chargers are not in use.
Power output 6kw free to charge parking 1$/h after 30 min
Powerful chargers. Seems a little far off from core of restaurants in the area but I found a great place to grab coffee and healthy bite only a 4 minute walk away at the Pupfish Café. Good coffee and nice people there.
"Powerful Supercharger. Plenty of stalls, many of them inside a free to access parking structure. If you enter the parking lot from the Main St. entrance immediately east of the intersection with US 19101 Business, the Supercharger stalls are right there on your left.

There are also some level 2 chargers if you just need to top up while shopping in the mall."
"Pretty brand new stalls here. Getting into the Sheetz gas station isn’t easy when there’s heavy traffic.

Food at Sheetz is decent. If you’re in the mood for burgers you’d be better off getting one from the BK across the street before charging.

8 stalls here though and wide parking spaces. 2 pull up and the rest are back in stalls."
Pretty busy location but in a well lit parking lot in front of a Target. Chargers have always been in working condition
"Pretty convenient but arrived early Sun morning and 7 of 10 spots were full of non-Teslas (I'm assuming hotel guests).  By the time I left, more Teslas had arrived and there was a wait."
"Pretty convenient location for a charging station in Norfolk, especially since options are limited. Take a quick break, grab a bite to eat and log into the wifi at Panera Bread or Qdoba across the street, maybe stroll through the Walmart next door and get a few groceries. Even a Bounce House for your antsy kids! I tend to pass by this station often since it's right off of I-64 and it's rare for me to see more than two cars plugged in at a time since there aren't many people with electric cars around here. With up to six superchargers available 24/7, I'm fairly certain you'll be able to get a spot here to charge."
Pretty convenient spot next to a Wawa. Fast charging also on a model 3.
Pretty convenient to have it across Mystic Village.
Pretty decent place to charge your Tesla except you’ll want to drive 35 mph most of the way to get there. The speed limit on that road is pretty low for such a low population area and it makes me wonder why it’s so low
"Pretty decent speed supercharger in parking lot of Ground Round restaurant. Pizza Hut and McDonald’s only other eateries nearby. Nice grassy area for dog to frolic, but watch out if it’s rained - no good drainage and I ruined a good pair shoes. Holiday Inn next door does not allow dogs."
"Pretty easy experience, 40 mins and you have 275 miles (85%) of charge."
"Pretty easy in and out.  If you don't mind a walk of a couple minutes, plenty of food options while you wait."
"Pretty empty, right next to target and has 250kW chargers, so you don’t have to worry about sharing your charge!"
Pretty good charge rate plus has window washing stations and trash cans
"Pretty good charge, last time I stopped here to charge was about 4 mos ago and there were maybe Teslas in an out as we charged.  Tonight we were there longer because I wanted more than the minimum to get home and every space was filled with occasion emptied.  Generally a good spot with a Harris Teeter off the left and a Walgreens to the rear and a couple restaurants straight ahead across the parking lot.  My only concern was the darkness of the area at night."
Pretty good food options in walking distance.
Pretty good place best view at any charger I have been to.  Nice to be by a grocery store
"Pretty good spot, but it is common to have non-Tesla vehicles parked here despite there being plenty of regular parking spaces. Its a 150kW charger, but I've never had it above 100. I've also never been here by myself though. Plenty of good spots to eat within a 3 minute walk."
"Pretty good.

Once the renovations are complete this will be great."
Pretty good.. Charged fast enough. Starbucks drive-thru nearby merjer parking lot. Well lit and safe.
"Pretty neat supercharger and convenient since it’s in front of a small supermarket. The one thing I will say is don’t expect clean bathrooms while it wasn’t a mess, it wasn’t to clean. But outside of that pretty solid overall."
Pretty nice and quiet place to charge.
"Pretty nice spot, specially when you are heading to Los Angeles through the 5 FWY (the next stop going south is 100 miles away). Pretty fast and easy access to Starbucks clean restrooms and a good Expresso to keep going"
Pretty perfect charging spot in the mountain market area. Super easy gondola access and covered free spots (in summer)
Pretty quick charging... we were out in 30 mnts
"Pretty secluded place, but we were sure fortunate to find it. Thank goodness by Tesla that’s just a rental. I don’t think I could deal with this on a day-to-day basis. I’ll stick to my Mercedes lol."
"Pretty simple and easy, my friend has a tesla ; v ; he took me with him to charge his car, we choose the one in Boulder because even though it's a longer drive, it's a lot better to wait an hour vs 4 hours with the charging station closes to us, it was pretty fun for my first time ; v ;"
Pretty slow charger. Disappointed the car advertises as 250kw but its actually only 72kw so my 15min charge took 40mins.  Luckily a lot of places around to eat/shop so location is great.
"Pretty slow charging compared to other superchargers. However, there were a lot of spots."
Pretty solid place to stop. Plenty of food/restroom options during normal business hours. Update: Target installed a trash can next to the chargers. Much more clean now.
"Pretty typical superchargers.

Luckily, there is a 24hr car wash in the rear of the main building if you need to clean off miles of dead bugs. Handy scrub brushes too for pre-cleaning/wash. $12 bucks for the top tier wash. (At this point I was about 3k miles of a 4600 mile road trip and the car was obliterated with bugs).

The gas station also is clean and has adequate snacks and coffee, and connected to a drive through fast food chain.

Wish all superchargers were 250kW+ for even faster charging."
"Price is .41kwh (no off-peak rate) and was very slow charging for me.  It's in a strip mall, so you have tons of places to eat - Wood N Tap, Taco Bell, McDonalds, Subway, Moe's, Panera, Ashley's Ice Cream."
"Prior to today's visit this was a really great charging location but the hotel allows guests to block the chargers which can be extremely problematic when all the stalls are in use as they were yesterday. Imagine needing to fill up at the gas station but there's someone blocking the pump.... overnight! With hours left on a trip this could really put people behind schedule or in danger of running out of a charge.

I can understand the need for parking but blocking the stations when there are open parking spots is ridiculous."
Private community but publicly accessible. Dylan's pizza had an excellent chicken parmesan sandwich which I highly recommend.
Private for Reynolds Plantation guests. Were very nice but guests are first and  to long a wait
"Pro tip: remember to tell your car in advance that you plan to stop at a super charger. If you do, it'll precondition your battery to charge at the fastest possible rate saving you tons of time. If you've ever been to a 250kw charger and only gotten level 2 charging speeds... This is the missing info that will set you straight."
"Pro tips:. ""The Hub,"" between Chico's and JCrew, has public restrooms at the back.  Panera and Starbucks are at the other end of the strip mall, which might be more of a walk than some folks want, especially in bad weather.   My daughter likes the sushi place (might be takeout only?).  We often order in advance from Chipotle (just outside the strip mall) and pick up on our way to charge."
Probably my favorite charging station because they have the EV Haven where you can go in and get some snacks and use the restroom. It's a great little idea
"Probably my top 5 TSC station. Near food and stores, a few walk to the rest room, clean, quiet, shaded and sufficient lights during the night. Free internet via Tesla Service."
Probably not a fast charger. Charging at 50 - 80kw even there is no adjacent cars
Probably one of cleanest and quietest superchargers I've been to
"Probably one of the better supercharger locations I've visited. Clean, high kw, very well let and always a spot to charge. Food nearby was not so good. DO NOT WALK ACROSS THE BIG PARKING LOT TO SI CASA FLORES. Terrible service, terrible food, overpriced."
"Probably the best rural Tesla Supercharger location I’ve enjoyed yet. At a Flying J/Subway/Cinnabon travel center. I repeat, there’s literally fresh Cinnabon’s being made inside lol. Also roomy and clean bathrooms. Good selection of drinks, snacks and essentials. There’s an extra long window cleaner squeegee at the chargers (first I’ve ever seen that) as well as paper towels and air."
"Probably the best super charger in SC. Easy to get in and out.

Right next to the Spinx gas station with tidy restrooms.

All V3 super chargers as well."
"Probably the most popular stop for charging between Dallas and Austin, and it makes sense. This has plenty of 250kw stalls conveniently located next to a bakery and more conveniently this stop gives you access to a free tea/coffee.

Restrooms are available from the bakery and the area is kept pretty clean. There are sometimes one or two stalls that have an issue but it hasn't ever been enough to make a big impact."
"Probably the worst charger ever.

Update: 10 minutes grace period and then $8 a hour for charging.

What a joke. Can’t they just move these station to a gas station? I would spend $8 on drink and snack while waiting.

Parking is $8 a hour and the charge is so slow you wish you have went to the one by Barclays instead.

I was here a few times and every time hasn’t been a pleasant charge. Either I have to move a few time to get a faster charge or the charger is broken.

They should just give the Tesla people unlimited access to charge."
"Proof a supercharger can go just about anywhere. This is a super fast charger, so even though there was a 5 min late we chose to wait and charge rather than going to the larger charger down the way because it's slower. We grabbed Smash burger and charged up while we ate. By the time we were done eating it had charged 15% to 80% 👍🏼"
Proper charging speed -. Great! Starting to get busy throughout the day.
Proprietor Tesla charging only.
"Pros: great bathrooms at the gas station. Very well equipped truck stop shop with supplies, food etc. Windshield washer at the charging station, needs a longer pole but it’s good.

Cons: very busy, all slots were in use during our time. This slows charge a bit while charging but not much. Just felt bad for people in line."
"Pros...15 stalls at 250kw
Cons...on a back lot dirt patch so you have to walk 10-15min to closest food option, which is McDonalds. Or grab McD first and come back to charge."
"Protip - Stop for food before you plug in.  No walking distance food options.   Max 145 kw, 500mi/hr, only needed 20 mins of charging before heading down the road.  Location feels safe,  Clean restroom."
Pull in has wheel stops too close to chargers. Protruding wheel stop fastners will catch on your undercarriage covers and tear them. Did mine three years ago. Be careful!Long walk to restrooms in mall. I guess out of luck if mall closed.
"Pulled in around noon on our way to the coast.  Lots of open stalls when I arrived, but a ""waiting list"" when I left.  Unfortunately car next to me was still there, unoccupied and probably done, (no sound coming from vehicle) but you can't control others...  Lots of food and shopping nearby.  Hard to navigate to due to nav tells you road names yet road is not marked.  Just stay close to entrance to mall, stalls are tucked behind Panera.  If you go farther than Target, you went too far.  Best advice, turn into mall road, take first left, then left and head towards Panera.  Area to potty your dog as well. Fast charger."
Pulling a trailer we had to drop it to charge. There was plenty of room to park the trailer. There were two pull-in chargers but they were both occupied.
Quick and convenient! Enter of things to do nearby. From whole foods and publix to ford's garage and cheesecake factory and much more...
Quick and easy charge location with a great view of the Blue Water Bridge and restaurant/brewery in the same parking lot 😁
"Quick and easy stop off the highway. Nice spot for dog walks. Others will park in the charging spots, but it's 10 min any car can park there. Everyone was respectful. And saw another review about this being free charging. It's not, only some older Teslas get free charging."
Quick and easy to navigate to utilize.
Quick and easy. In and out no problem.
Quick and easy. Was able to bring my car and charge it without having to wait for a charger. Plenty of spots in the lot to charge. Definitely would come back here.
Quick charge and decent number of stores and restaurants around.
"Quick charge. 8 minutes gets 90 mile from 85 to 170.

This is a great stop. Quick off the highway with clean bathroom and a place to buy snack."
"Quick chargers, next to an  , near a Taco Bell, McDonald’s and Holiday Inn Express. No actual dog rest area/dog park, no place for kids to play or families to eat their lunch in the shade. Just chargers,Arby’s and a giant dirt lot."
Quick fast charging.  I didn’t record the speed but was quick.
Quick stop and fast 500mph charge. Restrooms and a Subways in the Pilot Minimart.  Charge up here before Prescott because the town only has a couple level 2 chargers as of now Nov 2022.
"Quick, clean, and well maintained.  Be sure to visit EV Haven (a veteran owned business) is a great way to grab a snack, use the restroom, and get out of the heat."
"Quick, convenient and comfortable.  Lots of chargers, spot for pet relief, clean nice bathrooms.  Everything closes at 9pm.  Security guards everywhere."
Quick.  Busy for a Saturday morning.  Could use a trash can in the lot.  Easy access to Mall and clean restrooms.
Quick. Simple. And  charging was superfast!!
"Quiet and clean location near a residential area. Easy to reach off the highway, with local stores + grocery nearby"
quiet and convenient charging location in the mall parking lot so there's enough to do
Quiet and super clean place.
"Quiet eight stall supercharger behind a hotel or condo building. Four stars because there's a lot of activity in the parking lot, and the tarmac was in desperate need of repair at the time of this review.  Many open stalls when I visited on a holiday weekend, Saturday afternoon"
Quiet place. Not too much vehicles. Right behind the wawa. Trash can.
"Quiet, good place to charge.  Wish there were more snacks closer."
Quiet.   Directions say to make a right when it's a left going down Northside Drive.   Few assumingly homeless walking back and forth.   This was a wed night at 2130
"Quite a few things to do there
Like the healthy market place, they have quite a few good choices to eat
Spaces are a bit tight so be careful backing up...
And I saw a lot of model 3s there... They are making lots of those :)"
"Ramada Inn will let you use the bathroom and saunter around the grounds while you wait for your car to charge. The paved trail is nice for walking, biking, wheelchairs. Quiet area, pretty nice!"
"Rarely busy, and lots of things to do while I’m charging."
"Rarely do I use chargers because I charge at home. That being said, I needed to grab a quick fill-up. These chargers were amazingly fast, and it was only $0.17 per kilowatt hour during peak charging time. I got over 100 miles in 7 minutes, and this location has a lot of stalls. Well done!"
"Rated 4 only because the Tesla app navigates you only into the mall property, but not to the Superchargers specifically. Needed Google Maps to learn that they are at the SE corner of the property, opposite Barnes & Noble."
"Rates - 1hr is $20
Over 1hr will be $10/hr"
Rating for location (placed in a good spot in the parking lot) and number of spots (did not use on visit)
"Ready for vacationers and locals!

I was worried it wasn't in service with the UI in our vehicle stating it was operating at reduced service.

So far I've used two different chargers and they both worked as expected.

This station is so new that it doesn't even have labels yet as of September 5th, 2020.  6 stalls. I'm assuming it's going to be A and B stalls adjacent to each other (like the newer stations have).

Update (7/Sept/2020): 2nd charger from right keeps malfunctioning when trying to latch. All others are in working order as of this update."
"Really appreciated the public charging station. Free to use and easy to access.
Used Charge point J-1772"
"Really busy but lots of charging stations. Located in a parking garage but really dirty. Relatively slow speed chargers. Mind the right turn into the garage, the curb sticks out just right to be hard to see and you’ll curb your car if you take it too tight."
Really fast charge
"Really Good Supercharger. bigger than most, has 12 stalls and is really easy to get to from the highway. good food options, fine dining, quick and yummy pizza @Pronto, and a dunkin's .  the location is a little off in the tesla nav.  it's right next to the road, keep turning left :)"
"Really great location and right next to the most publicized pharmacy in the world!  WALL Drug!
One charger w kept trying to charge was over 515 mph and the car or it kept stopping and restarting, not sure what it’s problem was, switched to a different charger and charged at 480mph and worked flawlessly."
"Really great place to stop for Tesla drivers. Near downtown Sulpher Springs, so you can easily get dinner at a local spot. There have always been plenty of open chargers each time I visit."
Really hard to find the first time (it's in the parking ramp). There is a subway by the holiday inn that you have to show your card to so you don't have to pay for the parking ramp. There's an aquarium that's a walk from the chargers but it was nice to do while we waited
"Really kind of this hotel to let anybody who has a Tesla charge here for free. Really nice people, it does motivate you to stay here next time when people are so selfless.  You don’t need to be a guest to charge at the station, It’s right in front of reception you can’t miss it"
"Really liked this location. They have sitting areas right next to the chargers with table and benches for people in case you want to have a family meal there while you wait.
They also have two separate gated doggy resting areas for your pups to run and do their business. They're set up with doggy bag despensers and trash cans.
There's plenty of chargers available and this spot shares parking with a gas station with a large convenience store and clean restrooms. They have large trashcans right by the chargers and it's a clean well-lit area."
Really needed chargers! Best ones for sure around northern Indiana. V3!
"Really nice and neat position.

From south bay w/ 7 seats Model Y, 15% left from 90% start.
As of 1/28/23, price is 0.41/kwh

250w tops v3 charger, there is also a starlink nearby but seems not open to public access."
"Really nice folks here. Only wish it was higher output, only getting 7.8kW"
Really nice large charging station located right next to the Palisades mall. It’s very clean and there’s plenty of charging spots
Really nice pull in spots and great convenience store next door for bathroom and food. Not much else nearby if you’re hoping for food
Really nice supercharger in a great resort.  My kids really enjoyed the hand-made swing set while charging.  We used the restroom in the resort and it had a really nice western-ranch-themed lobby and everything was beautiful and impressive inside the lobby area.  definitely I wish there might be some events for us to stay here in the future.
"Really nice to have these services across I80, but my rating is relative to other SC locations. I understand that towns in the middle of the desert don’t have many options.
The rate of charge was one of the worst that we experience, plus it was a very hot summer day (102°), with no shade nearby. We only charged enough to get to another Supercharger down the interstate, so that worked out.
It is just off the freeway so easy to get to, and the Chevron station had a convenience store."
"Really rude staff, and ridiculous setup. Good lord it’s the 21st century, can’t you leave a Venmo barcode with a suggested donation based on usage? This isn’t rocket science. We opted to white knuckle it back to Pendleton rather than pay the exorbitant fee to charge for a few hours. We were told there might be an RV charger available at the state park up the road but we didn’t want to risk it."
Really?
"Really? Google map call it ""gas station"", seriously?"
Rebel Detailing LLC in Phoenix AZ is well worth the money and time it took to ceramic coat my 2017 X and my 2022 MS.
"Recently I swapped out the engine and electrical system of my AMC Gremlin with that of a Tesla Model S Performance.  You may be asking why. It’s because I’m just a humble person who doesn’t like to flaunt his ridiculous wealth. When people see the Gremlin exterior, they assume it’s powered by a straight 252 engine with 200hp and not a vehicle that offers a “Ludicrous Mode” of 0-60 in 2.4 seconds. Also, gasoline is expensive and I hate purchasing it.
Regardless, this specific charging station charges my Gremlin fully and satisfactorily. As an added bonus, it is all the way up in Alaska, so I get a nice long drive up from my home near the world famous Clown Motel at 521 N Main St, Tonopah, NV whenever I need a charge. Totally worth it."
"Recently upgraded to 16kw charging capacity.
Charge fast and FREE while enjoying a meal at Las Fuentes or shopping at Fred Taylor Furniture."
"Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Fuel City in Dallas, Texas, for a Tesla charging session. To my delight, the location offered fast Tesla Superchargers and, surprisingly, a group of friendly longhorns nearby. These charming animals added a unique and memorable touch to the charging experience.

Upon arriving at the side of the gas station, I was immediately greeted by the longhorns who seemed quite curious about the Tesla charging process. Their presence made for a pleasant and entertaining visit as my vehicle charged. I arrived at around 5:40 PM, and fortunately, I didn't encounter any panhandlers or safety concerns during my visit. However, I would exercise caution when visiting the area at night.

Overall, Fuel City offers a truly ""neat"" experience for Tesla owners looking to charge their vehicles while enjoying the company of some adorable longhorns. It's definitely a one-of-a-kind spot that makes for a memorable and enjoyable visit."
Recharging at 24 kW even though only car here.
Recharging was quick and easy. The station area was clean and everything appeared to work as it should. One suggestion would be adding waste and recycle bins as it is a prime location to clean the vehicle while waiting for a charge.
Redirected to this charger because less busy than Burlington a little further. Arrived with 15% battery and charge at 211kw on my model 3. A store for healthy and quality lunches right next door. No complaints
"Regarding the facilities, there is a port-o-potty for when the Sage Center is closed. There’s a recreation center and pool a short walk away if you need to get some exercise while you wait for your car to charge."
"Regarding the facilities, there is a port-o-potty for when the Sage Center is closed. There’s a recreation center and pool a short walk away if you need to get some exercise while you wait for your car to charge."
Regular stopping point to/from N. PHX - Florence.  Good eats and shopping spots.
Relative to other charging stations this place has a lot of chargers. But charges so slow. Also given the number of charging stations is kind of annoying how Tesla starts to charge you idling fees here when when there are still 5-6 chargers opened. It’s never once been at capacity.
"Relatively slow charging speeds for a Supercharger station. Can often be very busy as well (expect a line during peak times). On the positive side, the entire Supercharger station is in a covered parking area, so inclement weather and rain is not an issue."
"Reliable, relatively new level 3 supercharger with 250Kw output. Beware, this location is always busy due to city dweller with no access to home charging will come here for charging. Other than the location being busy almost all the time, reliable chargers."
Remember to charge car fully here if going westbound to next charger - we had over 100 KM extra charge and couldn't make it because of strong winds. Ended up getting towed and Tesla quoted us $1500 for a 2 day turnaround. LOL
Remote location. Not sure why I was not routed to the 250kw charger in Chicopee which is just off the interstate.
"Rental car from Budget, plug and charge. From 36% to 80% in 20 minutes. Thanks Tesla."
"restored! And charge, within walking distance to 2 restaurants and shopping! Terrific stop."
"Restroom, 7-11, all great.
However we got only 90+ kw despite no other cars next to us."
Restrooms are disgusting. Got here while it was being cleaned. Walked in and saw dookie on one of the seats.  The other was slightly cleaner.  The third was out of service
"Review By @ SoldByMarvin on Instagram,TikTok,FB

We had to stop in to charge a Tesla model Y long range on our way to Tennessee. The Tesla supercharger was very easy to find in front of Publix grocery store. There were several stalls available and folks were able to get in, get charged, and get out. It is off of a busy street so it gets pretty noisy but there are lots of food options within walking distance including a Mexican restaurant, Chinese restaurant, Popeyes chicken.

Since this is an actual supercharger our charging wattage here was about 120 kW so we were able to get from 20% to 90% within 35 minutes"
"Right along a great scenic highway. The amenities at the rest stop are pretty decent, despite being a fairly compact location. I've never run into any parking or overcrowding problems."
"Right at the intersection of highways 1 and 20, this charger is very convenient for folks either coming across from highway 101 (via 20) or traveling North / South on highway 1."
Right beside Tim Hortons at the Tamarack Center
"Right by a resort that has a bar and grill.  I stopped in to watch 40minutes of the Vikings game and they were totally cool with me just hanging out while charging.  Brainerd Motor Complex is just a few miles north, so this SC is very strategically placed in my opinion."
Right by Sheetz gas station. 150kw charger. Not bad and pretty close to I90 and OH route 2. There is convenince store by the gas station
"Right by the Chevron. Bathroom and fast food nearby, and a casino too. Stop and go, not a pit stop charger"
Right by the Hy-Vee. Convenient. Clean except the lawn drainage kind of mucus up some of the stalls
"Right by the railroad tracks off Cherry Street near the theater, easy to find"
"Right in downtown. Plenty of food, shopping and recreation places nearby. Never too busy."
Right in front of Courtyard  by Marriott
Right in front of the entrance. Very convenient.
Right in the hotel parking lot on left of the hotel. Go straight through the gate ( open mostly) and charging station on your right. Charging at 30 miles an hour. Sonesta Hotel desk will let you know if you need to charge and someone is charging. Thank you Sonesta Resort.
"Right in the side of an outdoor shopping area. Very convenient, and fast!"
Right next a gas station and police station. We grabbed some water bottles and felt safe in the area
Right next door to a taco bell. Super easy to get in and out of the spaces. We have stopped here twice on different trips and it is never too crowded.
Right next to a lot of shops. Laid out to where you don’t have to back in.
"Right next to a macadoodles which is great. They do have curbs that are far enough away from the chargers that the cable barely reaches the car, which is a bit odd."
"Right next to an Arby's, but it wasn't open despite it being during their posted business hours. Nowhere to sit or anything, but across the parking lot from some stores."
Right next to target and places to eat. Easy to get into and out from different locations.
Right next to the interstate in Milford Plaza but just got to 88kW max. Make sure to park close as cable is short.
Right off highway. Shared with Steak n shake parking lot.
Right off I-4 at a Wawa. Can't go wrong. Wawa has everything! Fast chargers and plentiful .
"Right off of the freeway, lots of options for fast food, next to an atm. But rarely available anymore because there's only 10 chargers. Pick an odd hour to charge here if you are a regular. They've had extra chargers built for months now, but won't release them for people to use. The unspoken Tesla etiquette is also not here because there are a lot of transients who use this charger. People litter and thrash this perfectly situated charging station."
Right off the e-way and a gas station convenience store is across the drive. Charging at just under 150kw.
"Right off the freeway and easy to find. Near casino which always seems to be busy, but I was left well enough alone. Mcdonald's is a short walk away as well as the casino. It was quite windy both times I passed through as I imagine is quite common."
Right off the freeway. Easy to get to. Right in the Rudy’s bbq parking lot. The Rudy's is clutch and if that's not what you want there are several walkable fast food places. Good cell reception with 5g (att) and full bars. Meets expectations on a supercharger near a big city.
Right off the highway
"Right off the Highway between the Mobil & Shell.  Actually, the SuperCharger is at  the Shell station.  We came in during a heat wave 122 when we were there.  The station has a Dairy Queen & Subway in it.  Great charging speeds.

As I was wanting I was thankful I wasn’t paying there gas prices. The chargers sit right on the side of the station.  It was nice to be able to use the window washer tools that we don’t normally have access to."
Right off the highway in a gas station parking lot. Clean and convenient place to charge.
"Right off the highway location. Beautiful mountains on one side, Peppermill casino on the other."
Right off the Highway.  Plenty of fast food and Circle K nearby.
Right on the highway. Easy access. Lot of charging points. Went in the morning time not much crowded. Charging was really fast . Model Y charged in 35 minutes. Would love to stop by again.

Ring the No at the side door the lady will show you where the charger is They work really well.
"ROOF TOP is Tesla chargers. Other brand on ground floor. Lots of chargers. $6-8 unless you validate, one located after cashiers at front of Whole Foods."
Roughly a 1/2 mile off the freeway in the Meijer grocery store parking lot. This station is on the very right side of the parking lot when facing the entrance of Meijer. There are several food options around and tons of shopping options nearby within a walking distance. Cell reception is solid on att with full bars on 5g. Restroom options are abundant although none are available after 10pm. There are plenty of grassy areas around for your pet to relieve themselve.
Roughly a half mile from I-40. Within walking distance of an Arby’s & a Chick-Fil-A. Lowes Foods and a few local shops & eateries to choose from as well. Has lighting for those that need to charge at night.
S9
Sadly there are no windshield cleaning supplies at the chargers. The food options in the vacinity are thin.
Safe and clean area. Food locations are nearby
Safe and easy to locate right off 108. Not a major intersection. Minimum fee applies.  cash only . Owner was cordial and made room for ample space to back up the car. Real Tesla charger. Long cord. 234v. 5 hrs to charge fully.
Safe area
Safe location… located at top of parking garage… 11 stalls … nearby locations for shopping and dining.
Safe place to support charge your car.
Safe place with cellular and wifi signals in the premises. Restrooms inside the hotel are clean and accessible to Tesla owners.
Safe place. Lucky to find an open slot. I Can this is a popular spot. They need some more between Houston and San Antonio. This is not enough.
"Same exit as the Triadelphia Supercharger that is located at a hotel on the north/west side of the interstate, but this is the better stop off this I70 exit. Other one is a long walk to retail/food, so you’ll drive for anything but a bathroom anyway. Sheetz has nice bathroom and tables. Chargers are by the drive through lane, no signage out front for Tesla."
"Same feedback as other people; no food nearby, no bathrooms and location feels like a destination charger next to a hotel. Charging speeds were ok and so far everything was functional. If you can, plan on stopping at the Fortuna Rd one (by Frys) a few miles away."
Same issues as other Sheetz with no enforcement on ICE cars parking in the EV spaces.
Saturday 11am. Only one other car charging. Across the street is the best bagel shop.  Trees provide shade.
"Saw extra temporary superchargers being installed as we passed through on 11/16. That should help accommodate the extra holiday traffic. Also recommend walking over to the mall entrance to eat and use the restroom at the new restaurant ""Inferno"". Ask for Riley. Really nice dude!"
Saw it in downtown parking lot in Inverness.
"Says it’ll charge at 250kw, but look at the picture. Also people don’t care if the spots for Tesla. They’ll just park anywhere, even though there are several car spots open. I guess it’s the area."
Says Supercharger but it's not. Expect 30 miles per hour charged max.
"Secluded and shady spot within a short walk from a mall. I have been to this one several times, and it's a pretty good one."
"Second visit in a week, but this experience went so smooth, I was done in 45min ( 20 of those were spent on charging it from 80% to 100%- since I knew I was going to drive around all weekend).
I hope they will get a supercharger station put in in Aurora ( there are a lot of people with Tesla here)"
"Seconding what others have said about this location. I was in Jackson for a week and probably used this charging station 10x. Out of those 10x, there was a gas truck parked in a Tesla spot about 30% of the time, which is lame considering there were plenty of open general parking spots at the time.

Otherwise the location is great - just outside the town square, in a Whole Foods parking lot, and a very short walk to Cowboy Coffee where you can get coffee, tea, drinks, snacks and burritos."
"Seem like new superchargers, gas station and Wendy's nearby for food and restrooms, not the prettiest of stops but not bad either."
Seemed a little slower than some others I've used but great food options within walking distance and in the parking lot of a grocery store.
Seems kinda sketchy at night during the day is fine. Nothing super close and no obvious bathrooms.
"Seems like it might be a single shared line between the four chargers here. When we had one other person here, we were charging only in the 59 kW range. When they left, it went up over a hundred (we were 2 chargers away).  It is located in a lot of the Holiday inn Express but it's a little bit of a walk to go find food or restrooms."
Seems like most of the stations charge very very slow. 30-115kW. Should not be listed as a 250kW. Hopefully tesla can come out and fix soon. Also the Carl’s Jr next door does not allow restrooms for non customers. Something to keep in mind.
"Seems like the Ruby Tuesdays is always closed when I hit this charger, otherwise only Walmart in the same parking lot. Dunkin is across the street but too busy to cross so get it before you charge."
"Seems like the super charger was initially planned as a destination charger…Asked to use the restroom and clerk indicated it was closed due to ongoing renovations, but only after asking if charging car…Decided to walk to the hotel across the street, since it was the kids needing to use the restroom, only to find this has been an ongoing issue."
"Seems to be a newer Supercharger station in El Centro. It’s hidden in the back of a parking lot by Panera. Stopped a Friday evening and had about 5 Tesla’s charging. There is food around but not a lot of options if you stop after hours. It’s tucked in the back. It is closer to the freeway than Dogwood charge station by the El Centro mall. Will prob stop here from now going to AZ since it’s a 250kw stop. In N Out, Jack in the Box and McDonalds are a quick drive."
Seems very clean and fairly new.
"Sept 2022 Update- stopped by again on the way to Pismo Beach. I was the only car here charging on Saturday morning. Got up to 220 mi/hr charging only this time around which was surprising. Took one star away because of that. They have chick filet close by.

Stopped on the way back to Bay Area from Pismo Beach. Found charging spot right away and got around 400mi/hr speed."
"Sept 25, 2022: Sheetz is being torn down! Chargers are inaccessible,fenced off, not even sure there’s power to them anyway. Would give negative stars if I could!"
Sept 26 2022
Several chargers available.  In the Hy-Vee parking lot.  Car was done charging before we could finish a sandwich from their café.  Nice clean grocery store with restrooms.
"Several of the units were running slow. On the third attempt, I finally found one that was charging at a decent rate. I have no idea what is happening with this particular charger, but it is not good!"
Several v3 superchargers in a hotel parking lot.  Bathrooms in the hotel.  Fast food restaurants were very close by.  You could walk across the parking lot to them while you charge
Sheetz + Hotels + Tractor Supply = happy Ohioan Tesla owner
"Sheetz and Tesla have a good thing going in PA.  The Sheetz has nice restrooms, cold or hot food, lots of coffee and tea options, convenience store items, and indoor seating with televisions.  Not a bad place to be if you need to kill a half hour."
Sheetz gas station cum tesla supercharger is super comfortable and clean. Reading other reviews before coming here got us a little worried but the people are helpful and courteous here. It is true non ev's are parked in the tesla charging spots but you should be able to find at least a couple of vacant charging spots for charging your teslas.
Sheetz on Berryville Avenue in Winchester has several Telsa Super Chargers.  Stop in for an MTO while your Telsa charges.  20 minutes got me about 80% battery.
Sheetz on Berryville Avenue in Winchester has several Telsa Super Chargers.  Stop in for an MTO while your Telsa charges.  20 minutes got me about 80% battery.
"Sheetz Rocks. Safe area. They have a restaurant inside, with an ice cream machine, and slushy machine, and coffee station. Here SuperCharger is 150 kW. Nugget ice, and extra sweet tea, and clean bathroom, and friendly staff. Supercharger is sandwiched between a McDonald's and a Burger King.  Lowe's and hotels in the area, and on a main road."
"Shell gas station, Hampton Inn, Police station and a chicken."
Shocking place
Shop while you charge
Shoppers are disrespectful and use the Tesla charging stations as parking. Tried to tell one non-Tesla owner trying to park in spots and was very rude. Charging speeds are slow at this location.
Short drive off the interstate.  Dunkin's in the same parking lot.  Convenient on the way to Nashville. Felt safe.
Short wait and pleasant charging experience. Plenty of department stores to shop at while your testy charges up :)
Should of looked at reviews prior to driving out. Sign posted charger is for customers only. Please check hours before driving out. Business is closed several days and usually don’t start till the evening at time of posting. Two chargers available to use.
Showed up at 6:30 am and was pulling 146 kW. Happy to have a fast charge this early. Tons of nearby stores to pass the time if you’re here during normal business hours. GPS navigation to location was good.
Showing 16 kw only getting 8kw
Simple as it should be with lots to do all around
"Simple charger, 4 spots, nice charge. Hot outside temps! Gas station is typical, bathrooms do have soap & paper towels."
"Since I'm waiting for my home charger to be delivered I've had to come here to get it charged twice this week. Monday & Thursday, both days I didn't even have to wait for an opening. Quick and easy!"
Since the super chargers are inside of the Embassy Suites hotel parking lot they were charging $5 CASH  in order to enter if you are not a hotel resident. Apparently the owner of the hotel implemented this rule since there is an event next door.  SUPER LAME SINCE THIS IS THE ONLY CHARGING STATION WITHIN 50 MILES.
Single destination charger. Great bar and restaurant. No charge to use the charger.
"Six 120kW chargers. Jack in the box/ Arby’s close by and the Shilo Inn next door for possibile restrooms. I managed to get to Arby’s, had a fish sandwich, and clean restrooms."
"Six chargers behind the iconic Conoco Tower building, which was built in the 1930s as a gas station/cafe along Route 66. It now houses the U-Drop-In Cafe and a gift shop. There's also a McDonalds about 100 yards down on the opposite side of the street."
Six chargers in a spacious area in the Comfort Inn parking lot. We were able to use the restrooms at the hotel.
"Six chargers in total, easy to find using Tesla GPS. Tesla employee was here fixing a supercharger while I charged. They maintain them well."
Six stalls behind a mall. Excellent charge speed.  Wife got to shop.  Life is Good
"Six superchargers located in the Grand Geneva resort, left side of Grand Geneva Way as you pull up to the resort. Not sure how it decides charging speed - was charged by the minute with top rate at 72 cents/min going around 145 kw/hr, then tapered down eventually charging 45 cents/min and finally 25 cents/min. Paid $15.19 for 45kw over 29 minutes (31% to 93% on MYP)."
Six Tesla chargers easily accessible and free to the public to use.  I actually stayed at a beach front condo about two miles down the road but this location was perfect to stop and top off my Tesla for the next day.  Thanks to Cinnamon Shores for these chargers!  👍
"Sketchy area, plugged in to charge and looked down to see a needle on the ground. Even middle of the day, it’s a last resort charging location."
Sketchy part of town. But convenient because of the WaWa gas station food. But nowhere to sit and eat besides in your car.
Skip the mini Mart at the gas station and walk to the Oasis. Grocery store. Everything including organic apples and ammonia-free glass cleaner. Lots of bugs in SD and MN.
"Skip this Supercharger if you can. Only charge here if you're n a pinch to make it to your destination. Only 6 Charging slots and 1 was not working. No restrooms, smelly dumpsters and a reasteraunts with very limited hours that is not friendly towards Tesla patrons. Charging speeds were as expected. Had to wait a few minutes for a charging slot to open up."
"Slightly challenging to get to, and the whole area was crowded, but none of the charger spots were ICEd. Three restaurants inside the truck stop. Charging went as expected."
"Sloooooow charger but good location. Says it's supposed to be 250kw but peaks at 70kw even though there's only 3 teslas here and we are all parked apart from each other.

Update: 1a gets around 160 kw but drops in kw the more you charge"
Slow
SLOW and because there are so many shops around this is not a quick in and out place. Lots just parked and left for hours. 100% capacity the whole time we were charging (40+ minutes and maybe got 80-90 miles)
Slow and trashy area...  need a trash receptacle.
"Slow charge (56kw), must pay for parking and very dirty."
"Slow charge, good if you like some shopping during business hours."
"Slow charge. Some of the charging cables are not working properly so need to move
To other chargers."
Slow charger. 23 miles per hour so estimated... 5 hr charge time.
"Slow charger. I’ve been here twice, at different times of day, neither that busy. Both times it would only get to 50kw max."
"Slow chargers , small area"
"slow chargers, 75kw, even after preconditioning battery & only 15% of charge on arrival.  moved to other chargers but the same slow output."
"Slow chargers, but there's restaurants nearby and the restroom was right by the doors of the restaurant of the hotel. They were clean! 2B is currently out of order."
"Slow chargers! Needed enough of a charge to make it to the fast charger in Raleigh, and could only get 56kW at station 3B. It would have taken an hour to charge wo I moved to 3B and got 103kW, which only took 15mins."
"Slow chargers.  Says 250K I can’t believe it.  I might consider another charger in the future.  There is a rest center with food.  Burger King, Dunkin, Subway and Panda Express."
Slow charging … 75 kw cap… if you have time to kill it is fun to go to Applebees but otherwise you’re counting down the minutes to make it to the next charger
Slow charging compared to some around Indianapolis but not nearly as slow as the one in city center. Plenty of options to eat and walk to while waiting to charge.
"Slow charging despite low usage on a Sunday morning. Even then, we had to pay $1 for parking. Not that much, just obnoxious. Luckily I remembered how to get to the chargers since struggling to find them a couple years ago.

On the positive side, while paying for parking you can eat nearby with lots of choices, and the covered space is a plus. In that respect, the slower charging speed works so you have enough time to eat while charging."
Slow charging from 2A. Moved to 3B and got much better result.  Also the new four chargers charge slower that the gen1 chargers.  Not sure why . . .
Slow charging speeds. Took me an hour to charge my model Y. The orange grove & I-10 location charges it in 20 mins.
"Slow charging, signs telling you to pay to park at a kiosk, but no actual gates preventing us from getting in/out of the charging area.
There was a security guard but he didn't say anything when we went to charge and just didn't pay.
We stayed with the car, don't know if they'd be more strict if we left while charging."
Slow charging. Although it has nice shopping needs
"Slow charging. Ok, plaza, there is a NY Pizza, and an Italian market, and a subway that you can buy food and us the bathroom. This place is pretty busy, lots of tesla in and out. There are 12 chargers, 1 out of the 12 is vac accesible."
"Slow supercharger. Two to four bays open when I was here but best rate we got in a 2014 P85D was 29kW/91-95mph of charge. Washington Square supercharger is usually faster, this location needs an upgrade and we need more superchargers in the Portland area!"
"Slow, but nice store."
"Slow, getting 80kw with no one here.  Fred Meyer is here, but no real food options."
Slower charger particular with split stalls. One stall evidently not functioning. Parking lanes newly painted and incongruent with charging positions. Facilities accessible but at least 75’ away in nearby casino.
"Slower than expected charging. Our Tesla estimated we should have been charged in 15 minutes before we arrived but then when we get there it says 50 mins :/ the gas station is well stocked next to it at least with sonic, bbq, restroom, and any other thing you might want"
"Slower than expected on 3B. 0.35/
kW so on the cheaper side of pricing.

They have signs that say “60 minute General Parking” basically encourages gas cars to park here. Other spots say EV parking. This set up will confuse the general population.

Old Chicago nearby. Applebees maybe opening again. Hard to tell.

Avid hotel nearby is clean and a good price."
Slower than other superchargers it's a 72 kw urban charger so probably only use when going to the domain or emergency circumstances. Otherwise it's great!
"Slower than others. Seems to be operating off a switching station or generator. With all bays full, charging is sluggish. Positive is decent location with lots of nearby retail and food."
"Slowest charger ever!
It would take 6-7 hours to fully charged a car ! Can’t believe in the casino town has no tesla supercharger!"
"Slowest charger I’ve ever been to and it’s always packed, even past midnight."
Slowest Superchargers I've ever been to.  You'll get decent miles if you're the only one there but it slows down drastically when other cars arrive and plug in.
Small but very conveniently located supercharger location with a Chic-Fil-A and plenty of other eats and shopping right in the parking lot.  Seems to be less busy than Knoxville so a great place to stop if traveling through.
"Small charging station with 3 or 4 slots.  I don't think I've seen anyone actually using it yet myself, so there shouldn't be any issue waiting for a spot to charge.  It's in Sheetz back yard so you can nip over to use their restrooms and/or grab supplies while you charge.  Or you can cross the road and try Combine Brothers if you want a more sit down restaurant."
"Small charging station with a few slots.  Conveniently located just off the freeway, easy to find, and clean.  There are places you can go to for a bite to eat, in the same parking lot, while charging your car."
"Small detour from I5.
Close to a lot of food places. (Starbucks, taco stand). Can use restroom in Starbucks or any other food place.

There is also a decent sit down restaurant called Taste of India.

Lots of parking space if you want to move your car after charging."
"Small station, half full on a normal Saturday morning, and there is NO FOOD near by. Nearest food is a 10 minute walk."
Smells bad but there’s a group of cute black tailed stray cats living under an antique mini bus that seems to be from PUBG.
Snow was piled up preventing access
So busy there!
So convenient with a grocery store being right there and so many spots available. This charged way faster than the one in Columbus.
"So convenient, right on the way to the park entrance. The charge was extremely fast and has beautiful views while you wait."
So easy to get on and off of I-85. Convenience store and restaurant offers great snack options. V3 charger gets it done.
So fast and easy
"SO glad there is a Supercharger in Door County!! Easy to find, plenty of room. Saw 2  others here while I was charging. Easy/peasy"
"So glad they have a charger here. This super charger has so many places to go while you too off, highly recommend."
So glad this is here.
"So glad this location is here but it has got to be the most remote location I've seen so far; literally in the middle of nowhere (no disrespect to Whitewood). The area around the chargers isn't even paved yet. Still, an easy hop off the Trans Canada and the first location I've seen with squeegies for cleaning your windshield! Plenty of stalls and fast charging. Enjoyed passing the time with a nice couple from Edmonton headed the other direction on Rte.#1. (Have fun in PA!...8-)"
So glad this station has a J1772 plug!! It saved us! Because there is NO need other stations available in a Sunday in all of Corpus!
So glad to have a level 3 250kw supercharger location in Lubbock.  Only 4 stalls but 2 more Lubbock superchargers are already in process!!!
"So happy that we finally have a supercharger in between Reno,nv and Klamath falls, or!Fast charging and they even have an island charger in case your pulling a trailer. Grocery store with clean bathrooms."
"So happy they have these, even if many people around here don’t have Tesla’s for those who do this is amazing"
"So happy to have this supercharger! Going the back roads from South Florida to Orlando. Usually we can make it on one charge but it’s always comforting to make a pitstop to go to the bathroom and charge the car a little bit while we do so. Sometimes if you hit traffic wrong or it’s extra windy, it’s just nice to have extra charge!

It’s located in a Wawa parking lot. The first time we were there plenty of stalls were opened. The second time we were there we took the last space but it didn’t appear that anybody ended up waiting at any point for a charger.

Wawa bathrooms were clean so it’s nice to be able to grab something to eat and go to the bathroom and stretch your legs while charging! It appears it would be well lit at night too!"
"So making my way to San Diego and I’ve stopped at this charger before. Key insight make sure you check how many kW each charging bay give as all are different. The Google Maps description says 120kW but the fastest one I found was giving me about 74kW. The others were twice as slow giving me only 35kW. I ended up at the second stall when you pull in (Black Model Y) and that was the fastest cutting my wait time by 50%.  So note to all Check all open charges if your getting a very slow charge on one. It could save you a lot of time. Cheers!

Edit: Jumped up to 135kW once the Model x next to me left (see pic)!!!"
"So many chargers available. Nice bench seating, Starbucks, gas station, subway, and Burger King within 1 min walk."
So nice of them to give 20% off your meal for eating while you charge!
So nice to have a place for Tesla owners to charge up while driving our beautiful mountains.   There are some good restaurants within walking distance which is nice while waiting.
"So normally, this place is a great stop, but currently the Comfort Suite is closed because of flooding! Ah! When the Comfort Suite is open, the bathrooms are clean and warm. Really delightful."
So slow
"So this charger is not available during the day like at all! Too many none electric cars are parked at the chargers. Out of 8 chargers, 6 were taken by regular cars.  Also, waited for food for 45 minutes. Got the food and it was gross. Bathrooms were disgusting also."
So this charging station is not a super charging station it would take five hours for you to get a full charge. The other con about this is that it’s in a private hotel parking lot called Wine & Roses. They  almost conned me into being a guest at their restaurant in order for me to use the charging station. I asked them if they had any charging stations that were specifically for Tesla’s and they said yes.I told them that I had every right to use the Tesla charging station because you can only use those for Teslas and those are open to the public you can’t make them for your guests only if it says Tesla on it. The guy seemed a little hesitant but I didn’t give them a choice so I’m using it but it’s definitely not a super charger I’ve been sitting here for 30 minutes and it’s only given me about 20 miles. I’m going to have to call Tesla to have them come charge my car since there’s no other supercharging stations nearby. I can’t sit here for five hours and it’s 5 miles from my hotel.
"So this is in the valet only section of the Casino parking lot, but the valets near the hotel were pretty chill when I asked if I could use the charger. One of them led me in his golf cart past the valet-only signs. I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to tip in that situation, but slipped him the Lincoln I had in my wallet to be safe.

The casino is a decent place to walk around and kill a few hours. No one really hassles you if you just walk around and don’t play anything. I was going from Louisville KY to Salem IN, taking the scenic route, and this gave just enough extra range to make that possible."
So you charge for station where is the sign at or pay as you go?
"So you drive up there, right? And then you plug your car in, right?
There is some magic that happens, then you leave and can continue to drive your car for more time without having to charge it again until your battery has less, which then you will drive back there for more magic.
I really don't understand physics that well, but I hear there is valence electrons that jump from one atom to another? Fascinating."
"So....first time renting a Tesla, but it's easy to figure out. This car is amazingly intuitive and pretty fast charging. The location was easy to find."
"Solar powered, attached to the Amavi tasting room. No reserved parking spot for charging, actually all close spots are reserved for people that work at the winery. We had to park partly on the gravel and lawn to charge."
"Solid 250kw charge spot behind Sheetz. Clean bathroom, plenty of grab and go for long distance trips. Sheetz locations are far superior compared to hotel locations imo. People have reported the chargers not supporting 250kw but I assure you they are 250kw capable. See pictures for proof."
"Solid 250kwh supercharger station. Conveniently located next to the freeway in the parking lot of Meijer grocery store. If you're looking at the entrance of the store, the station is to the right of the bldg next to the park and ride parking spots. There are several restaurants to choose from that's walking distance. Plenty of grass of your four legged friends and family members to do their business. Restrooms inside of Meijer are clean and maintained. Cell reception is good with 3 bars on 5g with att. I prefer this supercharger than the ones at Livonia even though it's farther to me than the Livonia station."
"Solid charge location, perfect if you order firehouse sub en-route grab a bite to eat while charging. Most of all this charger has 2 trashcan 🙂"
Solid charging station.  Charged super quick with access to a small mall to stretch your legs.  Fair restroom facility within the mall.  Kids loved the little turtle lagoon with many live turtles.  Limited dining options as there is no central food court.
"Solid location for a charge. Sheetz gas station open 24 hours, clean bathrooms and family friendly. Some shady characters around so make sure to keep your guard up and don’t get too distracted going in and out of gas station"
"Solid spot for amenities and the stalls worked great. I was there midday on a weekday and the traffic in and out of the gas station was steady, not terribly busy.

Hotels and other amenities in walking distance but it wouldn’t be a pleasant walk."
"Solid stop, at a Rudy’s so you can have a full BBQ meal while you wait. Their breakfast tacos are pretty good too if you find yourself here in the morning. Plenty of other spots in walking distance as well."
Solid supercharging stop with good speeds. Was near capacity at both visits going south and north but never had to wait. Wendys and gas station nearby got us by with some snacks and drinks but nothing over the top.
"Some of the chargers didn't work 😒 there were 8 chargers, and 3 of them weren't working!! Huge bummer when there were about 10 other Teslas waiting to charge, and we were all playing Musical Chargers to find ones that were actually working. Once we got a working charger, it was quick! It's not a bad location; only about 10 minutes out of our way."
Some of the chargers were under the snow. Could also benefit from adding more. Limited availability with wait time.
Some of the charges are broken and there is some people who parks in the tesla spot without having one.
Some of the cheapest off peak charging on the peninsula. 72kw with lots of stalls.
"Some of the stalls are quite slow, only getting up to ~50kW speeds or 160mi/hr. Changed to the “head in” spot and much more capacity on this one. Up to 103kW or around 300 mi/hr."
Some privileged jerk left their car charging there for hours and since it's just one charger a waited and waited.. they never came back..I think a policy that you can't walk away from a public charger should go into effect.
Some times it gets crowded because it is located nearby highway and big box store. It would be nicer if they add more stalls. 2 years ago was ok because only few owns EV in the area.
Some weren't charging at full speed. Took a few tries to get a good one. Gas station and a bar within a short walk made it convenient
Somehow only pulling 72kw when I was the only one charging here
Someone has cut off the charging cord😡
Someone left some plastic shards that blew my tire as soon as i pulled into the spot. 500 dollar charging yay.
Someone sabotaged these superchargers
"Sometimes it's busy, but I've never had to wait to charge.  Less than 50 yards from a wonderful Chinese restaurant."
"Sometimes there's a bit of a line...come prepared Tobe patient...
Best chicken and all the Great snacks for the road."
Somewhat difficult to find but definitely does the job
"Somewhat disappointed in this location.  I was spending the evening in downtown SA with my wife and friends and passed on free Valet parking to better further the electric cause and promote Travis Park's program with EV Charging and paid parking.  We plugged in, paid our $8, and made our way to dinner and a show.  Upon our return, we noticed the charger for my Volt was not working.  Evidently, the circuit went cold after about 2 hrs of charging.  I am not sure what might have happened, but if 2 hrs is the maximum charge time, this makes the effort much less worth it.  I would likely not try this again, unless I learn what the rules and limitations are for this site.  10/6/2012"
"Somewhat slow for only 3 other cars charging at same time. Did speed up after about 5 minutes, maybe it was my car and weather

Pretty good shopping center around, and a speed bump that people forget to break for :)"
"SORRY, THE TESLA CHARGERS ARE PERMANENTLY CLOSED. HOWEVER, THE BED AND BREAKFAST IS OPEN."
"Sort of in rough shape - one appears to be not working. Super busy, no obvious amenities. Nearby restaurant very kind to offer their restroom!"
Sort of out of the way (not right along the highway) but not too far from the main routes in and out of Sonoma. Signage for charging only (none of that '60 minute general parking' stuff).
South of town but a good Sinclair Service Center- just off the freeway - easy stop
"Southlake Town Center is the perfect place for these chargers, with convenient dining and shipping options. Just be forewarned that while the chargers are off the typical parking beaten path, there is a higher likelihood of being ICE'd when there are festivals or other events. The pics are from Octoberfest 2018."
"Spacious area, visible from anywhere of the surrounding area. Maintained pretty heavily. Nice and useful location aswell. Everyone is also really polite in this area, doesn't have to do with the charger but, helps people are nice."
"Spacious location, right off of 59. Back-in parking. There's a convenience store and Denny's for a food or restroom break. The convenience store salads looked pretty fresh."
"Spacious parking lot with a couple fast food places and mini Mary's nearby along with shops. Was here late at night, so many of them closed. Security passes by, and are watchful."
"Spectacular.  Simply magnificent.  Port insertion was smooth, power and strength was on par.  Plenty of trash nearby to attract seagulls.  A great Mexican restaurant very close with 83% of the staff very polite and kind.   Hardware store across the parking lot.  Everything you've come to expect from a super charged experience."
"Speed is around 72kWh. Charged my car at 5am and charged 51kWh, price was $0.20 per 1 kWh (December 2022). You also need to pay for parking which is $4 (up to 3 hours)."
Speed was as advertised. Hit 251kw from 13% charge. Location is bad for backing in as its the main road around a large shopping complex. Lots of options for food and entertainment while waiting.
Speedy and a full 250k
"Speedy charger, glad it’s here. Recommend grabbing food at Supa spice on the way to the charger because there isn’t much nearby the Superchargers."
Spent the night in Prescott. Charge for 2 hours gets ~ +17kWh. Enough to get me to a supercharger the next morning. Grateful they had one and it worked great!
Spots are in a good location off to the side of Acme.  Been lucky to not have to wait for a spot here.  Pricing is a little on the higher side but better than peak rates in northern NJ.
Spots were available but it was crowded. Could not get on my own a.b circuit. Surrounded by hotels. No convenience store or fast food within walking distance.
Sprinklers spray water over stations and car.   Ignorant night shift manager Jeannette claims this isnt hazardous.  Lets see.  Water and electricity.
Squeegee and trash provided by Hyvee. Trash was filled to the brim! We took advantage of the huge tent and table with chairs near the Suc and had our lunch there out of the car. Assume they use this for pickup of garden items when in season. A little far off I-90 but still a nice stop!
Staff is cool and let you use the restroom on your stop. They also have snack to purchase
"Stalking a Tesla  supercharger  and found exactly what we were looking for.  A blue model Y  next to a model 3. We love the height comparison and we will be ordering a blue model Y!!

Thanks for viewing my photos!!"
Stall 2A gave a speed of 84 kW.
"Stall 48 is not working other than that it’s a great location clean, people in the area are crack heads tho"
Stall 4B is defective. Not a lot of surrounding restaurants/shops except a carwash and McDonalds.
"Stalls are in the rear of the main entrance.

It was empty when we got here. Within 5 minutes we had a few vehicles.

Then an F150 pulled up and I thought we were about to be ICE'd. Turns out it was Tesla Energy stopping to check on something.

No problems charging at 95 kW for us.  It was easy to find off the exit."
Stalls are located right behind Clark’s. Perfect spot to stop for a bite while the car recharges
Stalls are usually available.  It's a wawa.
"Standard “next to Meijer” charging station. Within walking distance of 3 minutes from Biggby Coffee shop that has variety of hot and cold beverages, bagel sandwiches (customizable ingredients, served toasted or cold), and some treats.
Walking distance to Wings and Walmart.

The only downside,  nothing would be open if you stopped to charge in a middle of a night."
Standard 8 station 250kw charging station. New and clean. Very convient location. Located in the parking lot of a Busy Bee station. Need place to get snacks and drinks.
"Standard level 2 home charger but you CANNOT use it if you’re not hotel guest.
I was stuck with 2% and offered to pay them to use it for 30 minutes and they refused."
Standard supercharger.  No issues
Standard wall charger. Limited to 4 hours and you do have to pay if you’re not staying at the hotel. No one should expect freebies
"Starbucks, McDonalds, Wendy’s, Target!"
"Start off with I dont own a tesla so I can't say how fast the charging is, but i was located in the inn right across from it so i had a good view. It was pretty busy throughout the day non- teslas parked there, and one tesla parked in two spots. Definitely needs more chargers than just five"
"Started really fast 240+, but then slowed way down to 40 something."
"Station is actually on the side parking lot close to the building instead of in the corner like others. Has clean bathrooms and good food options (hooch bar and grill, schlotskys, and a local coffee shop). The convenience store is nice and had ot of employees.  They also put trash cans and windshield washing stations at the chargers for convenience"
Station is clean and peaceful. Easy to enter and exit. Downside is that the only facilities are inside establishments that are not open 24 hours. Safe area.
"STATION IS ON P2D
Okay so this place was very difficult to find, the charging station is under a parking garage, not under Target its the garage under Atlantic station.

Its on 20th street you make a left then enter and collect a ticket to pay for parking. Don’t worry parking is free for 2 hours and you only need 40 mins to charge.

When you get into the garage and get the ticket make the very first right and drive down.You will see 30 stations and the day i came in, it was kinda full buh yeah definitely took me a while to find especially cus i came from Louisiana."
"Stations are clean. Plenty of things to do while you wait. Starbucks, etc."
"Stayed at Hilton Garden Inn, Reno the last weekend of March 2021. Showing 4 Tesla chargers; but one is missing, one is non-Tesla (hugged by another Tesla owner for two days in a row) and the remaining two Tesla chargers were not working. If you are staying here, GOOD LUCK!"
Stayed at the Best Western and charged up. The chargers are easy to locate and functioned perfectly. Charged at 40Mile Per Hour on a Model 3.
"Stayed at the Quality Inn on 3/25/23 on our way back to L.A.. Super convenient to have the Tesla Superchargers across from our room. The Tesla map says the superchargers are offline, but called the manager to confirm they are in fact working. We actually skipped this location and used the Electrify America charger on our way to Austin because we saw that it was offline. So glad we got a chance to stay at the hotel and use the supercharger. Please be nice to the manager and mindful of your trash. The manager is super nice and he's had some encounters with really rude Tesla owners. Let's all be better and courteous to the hotel locations. They try and accommodate travelers with their restroom facilities and try to provide vending services with food and drinks. Also note that if you travel during the late night early morning hours they do close their lobby for safety purposes.  Great stay and awesome convenient charging location."
"Stayed here October 2022 for a trip to Zion National Park.  There are 4 Tesla destination chargers at the rear/North of the building, with 48 AMP output (or 32 AMP when shared).  Plenty of charging for overnight stays, regardless of how low the battery is.  No code or charging permit required, but the hotel has posted ""for hotel guests only"" on the charging posts.  There are also 2 Charge point J1772 chargers by the street entrance, but I did not use these."
"Stayed overnight at the Hotel, charged for 8 hours at a $1 per hour, great deal. Hotel staff were very welcoming. Highly recommend staying at this Hotel."
Still a great experience
"Still a very slow location to charge the car at, they need more power or a new location"
Still completely closed; the bags have torn off.  Why does Tesla still offer it as an option if it's been closed for YEARS?!  The closest one to that is on the turnpike going north a mile.
Still does not exist
Still incredibly thankful for Meijer and their commitment to sustainable transportation. This charger is conveniently located off 96 West towards Muskegon or East towards Grand Rapids. There’s a great Starbucks connected to the gas station for a coffee or sandwich. ChargePoint Stations as well!
STILL NOT a Tesla station.
"Still not working..

Correction: You have to ask the North Ogden Library desk to turn it on @ $1/hr👍 Change comes back in $1 bills and there are no strip clubs in the area 🤷‍♂️"
Stop and Shop. TJ Max. Papa Gino’s. Hamburger Place and a Wendy’s.
Stop by across the parking lot and get a popsicle for you and your dog.  Yummy for all.
"Stop by on Saturday✌️
24 stalls all available.

Convenient for a break on a trip, and also for bathroom, meals and some snacks because it is located in the parking lot of Buc-ee’s."
Stop on way to Del Rio and the charger was not working.
Stoped by on a Saturday afternoon. Want very crowded. Not many stations but was in a good and convenient location. Was clean.
Stopped and fueled at the store.  They were nice. Trucks don't run on chargers... yet.
Stopped at McCormick's creek to walk the trails and see some waterfalls. We were able to add a little charge while doing so. There are 3 Tesla Chargers. We have a 2020 Chevy Bolt EV but also have a Tesla tap. Thanks for the charge!
"Stopped at this 250kw x 12 charge station on 1/13/2023 at 11:45am.  No other cars present.

Charged our Model 3 long range from 27% to 81% in 18 minutes. VERY FAST charge rate - battery cooling system went into overtime and turned on our seat heaters to help with the fast charge. Outside temp was about 39 degrees F.

In a Meijer's parking lot, and there was a Burger King on the way out of the lot that we tried for bathrooms and food, but were shocked to discover their lobby was closed and only a drive thru open.  So we drove a quarter mile farther to an A&W / Long John Silvers.  That was very disappointing.

So the great 5 stars experienced with the fast charger was diminished by the lack of convenient local amenities.

Visited again on the return trip of 1/15/2023 at 3:50pm. Only 1 other car present. We charged our M3LR from 33% to 81% in 16 minutes."
"Stopped at this 250kw x 8 charger on 1/13/2023 at 9:25am and found 7 chargers free. Charged our Model 3 long range from 51% to 80% in 13 minutes.

A little cramped to make the turn and reversing into the charge spots, but no one around and no traffic so not a problem.

Too early for the Culvers to be open, so we drove next door to a Cracker Barrel for amenities."
"Stopped by 3 times yesterday to charge and each time at least 10 cars in the 2 cues, one on either end of the very narrow lot.  All 12 stations full each time with No room for parking. Finally, at about 8:15pm on a Saturday night rolled in again and I got lucky - no one in cue - Only had a 3 min wait.  I Can’t believe this is the only place in New Orleans to charge.  I had also stopped at a “destination charger “ but sadly found out they are only for guests of the hotels. For all the out of state travelers be aware!"
Stopped by for a quick charge and made some lunch while I was at it. Plenty of room and it was nice to have a restaurant next door if that's your speed. I made fancy top ramen to warm up on a cold November cold day.
"Stopped by for a quick recharge on my way to Pismo beach. Got speed up to 400mi/hr which is great. They have a lot of charging stations, over 30. Subway, Starbucks and TJ Maxx close by."
"Stopped by Fri. 11-12-21 for some refreshments and snacks store well organized and well stocked, as well as clean facilities. For all Electric Vehicles this would be a great stop they have (8) Tesla Charging Stations (see pics). I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Thank You for taking time to read this review, Please Follow all my reviews on Google and Please give me a Thumbs Up."
"Stopped by here on our way to Jim Thorpe just to top-off 10% battery before arriving to our destination. The chargers were plentiful, all works with no issue and the best part is that there is trash can in the supercharger area. It deters people from littering while charging."
"Stopped by here on the way to Montreal and charge. We arrived very early in the morning and the stall was very empty. Charging as expected, delivering very close to 245kw at 10% battery.
The location itself is very secluded from the highway, there is a diner next to it and shopping stores around the charger. Most of them were closed when we arrived there due to outside of business hours."
"Stopped by on a Saturday evening.

24 stalls are all available.

It is a very convenient location because of Buc-ee’s where you find all you need on a road trip.

This Katy Tesla superchargers location also right next to a CVS pharmacy:)"
"Stopped by on the way home to grab a charge on our new Tesla. The superchargers were easy to find, all were open, and of course, we charged and were back on the road within 20 minutes.
Clearly the locals know it is here, as while I was charging, two other cars pulled up, charged for maybe 10 minutes then took off.  There were a few stores within a 100 feet walking distance.. The Supercharger is at the front of a shopping center, so plenty to do if you choose."
"Stopped by the Supercharger station to charge my Model Y around 4pm, and there were many open stalls. Charge rate hovered around 70kw, when more vehicles arrived. Max I saw was 110kw.

There’s a Country store and BBQ eatery at this location. I did not visit, but the reviews are pretty positive. The eatery is a short walk across the parking lot from the Superchargers.

The location has Security onsite and Tesla WiFi."
Stopped by this supercharger 3x during my trip and all three times the charging was limited to 80% due to being high usage supercharger station yet charge was same.There is little choice in the Corpus Christi area since this is the only one besides 2 L2 chargers in Rockport.
"Stopped for a quick 20 charge for lax trip, easy to get into from fwy, better than wasting so much time trying to get into the one at temecula mall which is full light and  traffic in all directions.
Plenty of fast chargers on a saturday morning"
Stopped here around 2:30am and it looked super sketch. We rested our eyes while we charged until we heard gun shots. Then we saw a pick up truck with pallets in the bed of the truck make its way over to the chargers so my husband unplugged and we decided to leave. Once we got to the intersection to leave a cop pulled in and then we heard a gun shot again and then cops with sirens came from everywhere. We immediately left. I don’t recommend to stop here at night. Not well lit and it’s backed up to a dark area. Definitely not safe. Especially if you’re driving alone.
"Stopped here for the first time today.  Not busy, great area, super clean public bathrooms close at the mall. They had trash & recycle bins that weren't full or spilled out on the ground.  Highly recommend."
"Stopped here last night to charge my Tesla and all of the stations were damaged and not working. The handles on the chargers had the plastic broken off of them and they were laying on the ground in the parking lane instead of hung on the charger. My passenger had to get out and pick up the hoses and charging handle off the ground just so that I could back into the space without running them over. Only one would actually plug into my car. The others were too broken. Once I plugged the  in, it wouldn’t charge. Writing this to save anyone time who might be driving to this location needing a charge. Recommend the charging station in Rowlett about 10 miles away. Next to a nice park and restaurants."
"Stopped here late at night.  Not much around was open, so keep that in mind.  The charging experience was flawless, tho."
"Stopped here on way from Park City, UT to Rapid City, SD. In parking lot of older shopping mall. Lots of chargers, but very slow. Patch of grass for dogs very close, though. Applebee’s and Sapporo Japanese place nearby, but no other food options within walking distance while you wait for charging."
Stopped here over the summer on the way down to Virginia Beach.
"Stopped here to ""top off"" our charge on the way back from Door County on our first road trip in our Y.  It was conveniently located and had several restaurants and  Kwik Trip nearby (sorry, no gas purchased, but we always buy something if we visit the restrooms).  We charged from 25 to 50% in 10 minutes.  That was more than enough to get us home."
"Stopped here to charge my Model Y LR. Coming for the day from Pacifica, CA. Just a few spaces (6), but very clean and I plugged into 1A and hallelujah, it's charging at 138kw. I was down to 50 miles and I'll be on my way in less than 1 hour. Meantime went to Save Mart to get some food! Perfect way to end a beautiful trip to Tahoe! Soooo Glad I went with a Tesla as their charging infrastructure is second to None! No range anxiety here!"
"Stopped here while vacationing and passing through. Location is right off the highway, so super convenient. No issues on the day I charged up with the chargers themselves. Not the most ideal spot if you were hoping to walk to a restaurant with the family while the car is charging, but other than that no issues."
"Stopped in at a friends house close to here and decided to top off my 3 because, you know, this is a 250kW station.  What a joke.  We only got 29 - 30kW and there were only three other cars there.  BTW this is one of the split chargers with the 1a through 1d, etc. designations.  Good thing I live close to here so I don't have to use it again.  Sheesh."
"Stopped in on a Wednesday in the late afternoon. A few of us here today (two Model 3’s, one Model X plus myself). Decent location right in front of the gas station which was packed. Wendys right beside the gas station. No issues."
"Stopped on a Sunday.  There were 2 other cars there, but several more came in.  Clean area, grass area for dogs and play area for kids.  Sage Museum is closed weekends, so no restroom or other amenities.  But there is a rest stop 2 miles west.  4 stars for no restroom..."

"Stopped to charge on 3/23/23 with only 2 other Teslas there, couldn't get over 30kw even at a low state of charge. Not sure what the deal was, tried 2 different chargers"
Stopped to charge while towing our trailer and we’re lucky enough to find no one charging though one Tesla arrived as we neared completion of our charge session. There are places you could drop your trailer if you needed to back in to charge.The food at Smithfield’s Chicken ‘N Bar-B-Q was excellent.
"Straight forward get in plug in, wait and out, price are similar to non supercharger.  If you don't have at home or at work use the supercharger station"
"Strange charging experience here. It's in the back lot of a Tesla showroom. We were coming from Santa Rosa NM, ~200 miles away. We were a little range anxious, as there was not much in between. Lubbock showed 0 chargers of 4 total available. We figured we could wait in line, if needed.

Well, down the road from Santa Rosa, the car rerouted, wanting to take us back to the charger that we just came from. We rebooted and it sent us on our way, so we pressed on.

When we arrived, all 4 chargers were available, but the info still showed zero. We were charging at 250kW until we reach about 75% when it dropped to 25-30kW. Luckily it was enough to get us where we needed.

If the showroom isn't open, there are no bathroom facilities on premises. You can walk to some fast food places from here, but the paths are not the best."
"Strangest setup for charging I’ve seen. You have to call for someone to open garage, it’s a 3-car tandem parking situation (meaning you could be parked in), and you’re required to be dining at the brewery for the entirety of the charge. If any of this had been listed online, I would have avoided."
"Strong supercharger, easy access and not currently crowded!"
Such a great spot! Whenever I pick up food from healthy living it's convenient to be able to charge on the go. Radical!
"Sucks that it is in a paid parking garage, but it works fine. $3 to get in and out of the garage."
"Sufficient light but no rest room at night. It is almost hidden, it is beside Verizon but behind Safeway. If you can't find it just find a way to go all the way of the back of Safeway. There are 11 chargers at 120kw (01/23)."
"Suited the best for those who travel on I-476 South. Otherwise, you must drive an extra 25 miles to back on North Band."
Super charger right behind the hotel and in the middle of downtown
"Super Charger that goes up to 250 kw, at the back of shopping center with Wholefoods. There’s 8 stations and each one is connected to 4 units (1A-1D, 2A-2D). The one near our house is only up to 150 kw, so extra 100 kw is nice. There’s several food options here so that you can eat while you charge up."
Super chargers are great . They charge vehicles with in 30 minutes.
Super chargers were great. No local food around the Sheetz station where the chargers are located. I'd suggest not eating the hot food here. I make this stop weekly and each time I have the tried the food from their order bar I got the Sheetz. But the chargers are great
Super charging station but panhandlers find drivers in Tesla's easy marks
"Super chill supercharger, pretty convenient Wendy’s, as well as gas station snacks available. The bathrooms are OK. Not super clean so just keep that in mind plenty of space to walk around or to walk your pets and that’s about it."
Super convenient
Super convenient 250kW superchargers (8) located next to Wawa off Rt. 31 (1 Minute off Rt. 202 in Flemington. Usually only 1-2 Teslas charging here except for the the occasional ICE car who park when rest of the lot is full.
"Super convenient location in a shopping center anchored by Best Buy, Dick’s, Ulta, PetSmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, Marshall’s & Ross. Several food options and smaller speciality shops just a short walk away across the parking lot."
"Super convenient location in conjunction with a Pennsylvania rest stop. There’s food, restrooms, and a place to walk the dog."
Super convenient location with enough chargers and ample shopping and dining available.
"Super convenient location, McDonald's and Timmies nearby, lots of chargers"
"Super convenient location, right next to the gas station with eight different charging stations. Plenty of room, the superchargers were clean and well-maintained and as always… The fellow Tesla owners are kind and courteous. Definitely the perfect place to stop in Western Arkansas if you were looking for a supercharger."
Super convenient off the 17 at the Tesla dealership. It's sometimes full but you don't have to wait too long for a spot.
Super convenient SuC location for a extended vacation in Moab. You can see all the parks in the area with zero stress
Super convenient supercharger and love that it’s next to a gas station!
"Super convenient supercharger right off 45 & Cypresswood. I’ve never had to wait, even at 5pm. Plenty of lighting & there’s a convenience store open until 10ish. Target & many food places walkable distance.

There’s no trash cans near the chargers, so please help continue to keep the area clean for our charging needs."
"Super convenient to charge while grabbing a coffee or running errands in Williamsburg or having a drink at the rooftop bar of the hotel.

Valet is great and reasonably priced for a hotel in NYC ($6 for an hour - and I've not been to any supercharger in the city where you pay less than $3 TBH), they send you a link to your phone so you can ask for the car to come back while walking back"
Super convenient! Look for pillars L and M.
Super convenient. Great location. Its located near a bunch of stores nearby like Mc Donald’s and starbucks.
"Super convenient. We stopped here for one night and Cedar Lodge was able to accommodate us -- we really appreciate that! They have two Tesla chargers. One by the office and one just up the road across the street. Both worked great. Also, the Lodge is really nice and the staff were great."
"Super cool, fast, and quite, 🙏🏼"
"Super crowded, lines painted wrong, slow charge rate (24kw or 98mi/h)."
Super dirty charging station. Stickers all over charging charging docs and trash all over
"Super easy location to find right off the freeway.  Very clean,  safe looking area.  We were the only one there.
A couple hotels and shopping across the street.  Target and a Dollar store.  But if you're a fan of the show,  there's a Bob's Burger in the same parking lot!!"
Super easy to use and thank god cuz I literally had no idea what I was doing. I rented this car and got a 2 min preview of what to do. It’s been a roller coaster 😂
"Super Easy, not crowded at all, thanks Elon"
"Super expensive, equal to gas prices. Just got 24 miles range for $3. Skip this station."
Super expensive. Just paid $30 for 260 miles. Awful
Super fast
Super fast
Super fast ⚡️😎
Super fast 250k by the time you pick up a snack at the Stop & Shop you’re already paying idle fees LOL…
Super fast and all 8 stations were being used.
"Super fast and easy access to highway. My MY preconditioned battery took full 250kw, 800+mph rate them tapered down as expected. While i was there, 4 of 8 were in use. Dunkin' there and a mobile Mart next door."
Super fast and plenty of chargers..  best supercharger I have used so far!
Super fast and rarely busy. All it needs is some shade.
"Super fast and stations are usually available. I come early in the morning to take advantage of nonpeak rates (I think $.29/kwh vs $.47/kwh before 8am). It's actually cheaper than charging at home (depending on which plan you have from sdg&e). It takes about 15 min to get to 80% charge. But it takes over an hour to get to 100%. Charging slows down for that last 20% then it ""calibrates"" for another 20 min--whatever that means. Unless you are eating or shopping (lots of options in this center), it's better to just do 80% and go."
Super fast charging even for 2.0 cars. It’s right behind Wawa which means easy restroom and food stop.
Super fast charging with easy access in what seems to be a safe area.
Super fast charging.  Easy access to charging spaces.
Super fast station. Charges the car 1000 miles per hour. 100% recommend.
"Super fast Super Charger with l2 charging bays.  Located on right side of Meijer parking  lot, as you might expect.  The roads around here are pretty busy, but no wait at charging station.  Look for a Best But or Meijer and you will find it.   Easy on and off from 75.  Check out the charge rate in photo."
Super fast this charger for Tesla. And also have a nice Wawa store
"Super fast, and a nice variety of shops, suggestions to add a trash bin while i wait ( maybe that way my car might be clean lol)"
"Super fast, plenty of spots open. Right off the freeway. Plenty of options to eat, take a rest."
Super fast!
Super fast. Great windshield bug scrapers.  Nice stop for sure.
Super fast. In a Meijer parking lot. Food nearby. Lots of grass nearby to take your dog out.
"Super fun place!  We got there after hours but still got some fun photos.
NOTE: There IS a restroom you can use even when the shop is not open.  It’s next to the garage with the antique truck.  Its a single person bathroom, that is not inside the building.  The door opens straight onto the sidewalk.  I assumed it was closed…but a friendly fellow charging Tesla driver told me they were open.

The photo helps show where the bathroom is 😂"
Super glad they made one in turlock. Tons of food amenities there.
Super good
"Super great location! It's only been open a month and we used it coming from Austin to fburg. It's near a subway and dollar general, in the same parking lot. The dollar general says no public bathrooms so we ran across the highway 😬 to use valero's while we waited. 1,unisex stall."
"Super happy they installed one there. Only negative is that it's in a Hy-Vee parking lot and you have to stop and then back into the charging space, thus delaying whoever is behind you getting their Budweiser from the store. Might even get you a middle finger, if you're lucky like it did me. Don't worry though, considering the Watertown folks, be lucky you didn't get shot 👍"
Super helpful super charger location. Navigate to this location on your cars screen then the code will be on that screen. It’s in a garage so you need a code to enter. This is way better than having to go to the Winn Dixie location 🙏
Super location but very busy. I recommend avoiding business day lunch times if possible.
"Super nice folks here. The manager was kind enough to let us use her bathroom.
The chargers are free but slow. In a pinch, it’s great. It gave me the extra 3% I needed to feel comfortable for the last leg of the Havasu drive."
"Super peaceful, pleasant area and the area is very clean. Definitely would charge here if you have to."
"Super quick, never crowded"
"Super scenic drive, it's worth stopping at this charger just for the views along the route. It was pretty empty and only saw two other Teslas. Directly next to a Shell gas station"
"Super slow charger. Stopped here at about 8:30 pm, only 1 other car. In parking lot of Sheetz mart/gas station, light poles didn’t work in area of Tesla chargers. I’d skip this one if you can avoid."
"Super slow. You’re better off driving 10-15 min to a real supercharger. Also, you have to pay to park here."
Super speed and nice location..
"SUPER SUPER SLOWWWWW
do not charging your Tesla here"
"Supercharger at a Buc-ee's. What more could your ask for? My only problem was that the Tesla navigation thought this was located in the middle of a gigantic intersection so it took me a long time to get here. If you're coming here, just navigate to the Bucees instead."
"Supercharger at a convenient location with a major supermarket across the parking lot. Unfortunately, a second generation charger."
"Supercharger at a Sheetz? YES PLEASE! Conveniently located at the side of the parking lot, there is also a touchless car wash right next door."
Supercharger at the back of the Stanley Hotel. The hotel may charge $10 for parking but they haven't charged us on our 3 charges. Hotel has a nice bar. Safeway and a few other stores are in easy walkimg distance. Large elk guarded our car during our last charge.
Supercharger behind a hotel. There's a bathroom but not much else besides a big hill to climb. This charger seems very busy sometimes; with only 6 v2 stalls you're likely to be sharing a circuit.
Supercharger for northbound
Supercharger has 8 stations and shares parking lot with Flying J gas station. There is also a Wendy's inside the Flying J. Charged at 100kw. Even has a grass area nice if traveling with pets.
"Supercharger in the parking lot of Parker's which is a large gas station/convenience store.  Got 250kw at first but down to 140'ish at the end.

Still, good location for a Supercharger."
"Supercharger indeed! 12 brand new charging stations. I was pulling 140KW without any issues (Model3). Also, 20 steps away from SteakNShake and Texas Best Smoke house. Great location indeed."
"Supercharger is cheaper at $0.34 kWh, but beware, don't ask to use the restrooms at the Sunridge Bar and Grill. They originally refused, but shifted gears when when we were polite and didn't give pushpack. Regardless, I'm weary of the chargers due to the owners of the restaurant stating they haven't been paid by Elon and threatening to bag the chargers. Unsure if they can do this, but wouldn't be surprised to see them blocked or bagged. Hopefully no one has issues and Tesla can work this out."
"Supercharger is fine, but there's nothing around. Use the bathroom the in the hotel and just wait in the car. Good place for a short charging session."
"Supercharger is in the Oxford Suites hotel parking lot.  The side door closest to the charger may be locked so I had to go through the front door and walk by the front desk liked I owned the place lol.  Bathrooms are not on the ground floor.  Stairs were ""blocked"" to get to the basement where the bathroom is.  So taking the elevator just past the front desk might be the better option.  Ice machine on the first floor was helpful for me."
Supercharger is located in Whole Foods parking lot —GENIUS!!!
"Supercharger located in the Bayshore Mall in the south part of Eureka on the west side of 101. Used stall 1A and got 400+ miles/hr at first. Charge was good the whole time, up to 80%. Lots of bathrooms and eating options in the mall. Not sure what available out of normal mall hours."
Supercharger location
"Supercharger near Ocean City Maryland on Rt. US 50 just before the bridge into Ocean City. It's conveniently located at a Royal Farms. As you can see from the pictures, at first the electrons were flowing very fast. When I had only sixty miles of charge, the battery was accepting nearly 500 miles of range per hour of charge. If only it had stayed like that, but no. It didn't.

As the amount of charge increased, the rate of charge decreased. I'm told that this is what happens at all supercharging stations. By the time I got to 80%, my rate of charge dropped to 146 miles of range per hour of charge. By the time I was closing in on 90%, my rate of charge was around 100 miles of range per hour of charge. Clearly, the best strategy for long trips is to keep the battery below 80% because recharging above that takes a long time. This works only if charging stations are very close to the route and reasonably close to each other.

Another trip to O.C. Different charge stall than before. Still works the same way. My strategy, when spending a weekend in Ocean City, is to top up the Tesla right before driving into O.C. That gives me enough electricity to get through the weekend without recharging. Then I recharge on the way home."
Supercharger space partially block by non-EV vehicle.  Maybe a Model 3 can get in there but DEFINITELY not the X.
"Supercharger stations make life so much easier, reducing wait time to a quarter of normal charging. The first time for us to drive a Tesla, which we rented for a few days... If we weren't in a hurry and didn't have timely needs to be met, than it wouldn't have been so bad."
Supercharger was fine. Easy to get to off the highway. Hope you like Jimmy Johns if you're looking for a place to eat.
Supercharger worked as expected. Would have been nice to have more amenities such as food close by.
Supercharger working 100%
Supercharger works great easy to use and has amenities near by. 🙂
Superchargers are at the end of the lot with a Dunkin Donuts and separated with landscaping. The chargers face an open field and are separated from the chargers with concert barriers limiting the turnaround space. Definitely an area you would not want to take a trailer.
Superchargers are great. Short stop to top-up and touch base with other Tesla drivers.
Superchargers are in an ok location.Not a fan of the town Childress.The stop though is nice and clean.The convenient store has a wide variety of snacks and drinks to choose from.This is our second time stopping there on the way back from CO and two stalls were out of order.I believe a total of 8 stalls are at this location.A Starbucks not far is opening up in 2 days. I would look forward to stopping here again if I had to.
"Superchargers are located at the edge of a nice shopping center. I used charger 4B with my Model S 75D and the charge rate started at 80 kw on my 40% full battery. The location was less than half full on a Saturday morning.

There are several restaurants in the shopping center and many retail shops. If you must have snacks to go there is a Wawa near the location that is walkable."
"Superchargers are right next to Ulta, behind Firestone tires."
Superchargers easy to find and work well. This Sheetz seems busier than some of the other ones we've been to.  There's some nice tables nearby to relax out of your car.
"Superchargers here are fast and good but frequently VERY crowded on holiday travel days. The Sheels is huge and has a ferris wheel etc inside to keep kiddos busy/moving but the cafe inside is AWFUL. I mean absolutely horrible. Terrible food and definitely NOT sanitary (gal making sandwiches her belt was hanging onto the food, timers were not working for the ovens so the gal was touching the food to see if it was warm, etc.) We'll try a restaurant across the way next time!"
"Superchargers in the parking lot of Buc-ee’s in Katy. The super chargers are a short walk to the store — if you’ve been to other Buc-ee’s locations for a charge, you’ll appreciate that you don’t have to walk through the gas pumps to get to the store in Katy. This particular location is almost comically large, with endless rows of urinals and Texas-sized bathroom stalls, a vast array of home goods and apparel, and a massive wall of jerky. As far as the chargers themselves, they’re 250 kW and there are 24 of them. There are trash cans located near the chargers. It’s a great location to stop for a fast charge."
Superchargers with everything Buc-ee’s has to offer. Best superchargers between Dallas and Austin.
"Superchargers work great, not sure if V3, but had to use 1B when 1A was occupied and still got max charging.  Men's restroom was closed (no urinal, toilet, sink, nothing) - seems like newer building so hopefully will be back open soon."
"Superchargers worked great and store was clean and convenient, but price was .41cents per KWH. Price was kinda ridiculous. Super happy with everything else except price. 2023 LRMY"
Supercharging has easy access and wasn’t too crowded on our trip up and down the mountain. The Copperopolis Town Square is really cute. Stop for lunch or dinner while you charge. The bbq joint smells great. And ice cream at Copper’s satisfied the kids.
Supercharging in St. Louis proves that Tesla considers STL a second class city. Limited locations and the slowest charging I've ever encountered.
Supercharging station was quiet and clean. Gas stations nearby to grab snacks or use the restroom while charging
SuperFast and convenient. Thank you
SUPERFAST V.3 Supercharger - arrived at 35 miles and charged to 270 miles in less than 20 minutes!
"Supposed to be 120 kW.  I'm the only one here and can't get over 90kW.  It's 70° outside, so it's not hot.  The location seems fine with Starbucks and Meijer Convenience.  There is an ICE car parked in  a charging space as I write this."
Supposed to be 120 kw. Charged at 40 kw abd stopped working. Definitely not super
"Supposed to be a 150, but we are only getting 70... same pull at both 1B & 4B.  2A&B are down."
Supposed to give 250kw.  We got less than 60. And we were the only car in the EV section.
"Surpringly busy for midday Sunday, we got the last spot. Thankfully it was conveniently located near a variety of restaurants. It was located at a Sheetz gas station which was good for a bathroom break as well snacks & drinks. The area was relatively clean."
Surprised by some of the other reviews on this location. I've charged at this location many times and never had any issue. It's a new location as well I'm pulling great speeds when I visit it.
Surprised to see all spots were taken except one. Convenient location next to Wawa and close to the highway.
"Surprising location for a supercharger, but something in the area was needed. Small town, family-run quick stop around the fence with restrooms inside. Sadly max’d our at 92kw, but better than the loaded Trinidad stop."
Sweet 🧁... 😫 In my purple 1984Chevy pickup 🛻
"Tahoe city is Tesla friendly and EV in general,  alone with 6 stalls of superchargers there is one nifty Tesla charger that will charge you at the speed of 27mi/hr or 36A for free!  Good job Tahoe!"
Take the free gondolas into town!
Takes a lot of fossil fuels to make all those batteries!
"Talked to some people who travel through here so keep that in mind, but when we pulled up there was no way to charge and was blocked by a driver (who drove for Ryder) who did not care that he was taking up space and not allowing access to the chargers. Went into the hotel to ask about it and the hotel clerk knew who it was and said they are taking a shower. So for me who travels long distance a bit, think that speaks volumes in itself. It's a shame as these are the people who make it difficult for people to switch over to EV's. (New drivers trying to travel and not understand this should not be a thing"
Tapered down too 64kw at 60%. Clean area but not too much around.
Target in walking distance. The door to the charging equipment were all broken open. I suspect that someone might be living in there. The charging area smelled really bad. Someone is obviously going to the bathroom here regularly.
Tasty both on electron and burger fronts.
Tbh...I am not sure how a supercharger that works isn't good....but it is in a mall parking lot that isn't too far from a mall entrance. It was clean and of course has beautiful AZ scenery. There were also several charging stations.
"Technically, I didn't use the Tesla one. However, the regular electric vehicle charging station next to it is free as well and works great! I will never understand why Tesla and the regular models have different chargers but both work great. I saw several Tesla's using this super charger station."
"Terrible design. No easy way to make queue, so it was a free for all trying to get a spot when one opens."
"Terrible location in the winter. Nothing nearby and only 4 stalls. No real walking paths to more distant amenities, just a steep snow covered hill.

The hotel, a Hampton Inn, doesn' even appear to have a restaurant on site.

Avoid this location if possible."
"Terrible supercharger station. Rental car companies from TPA use this charger to have employees drive the returned model 3 / Y here to charge them to “100%”. On a Saturday between 3-4pm i counted 14 tesla rental cars coming and going, with chalk on the windows stating “low charge” or “needs charge”, a sign that they are not private vehicles and also not customers driving these rental cars in need of a charge.
Since they the rental car employees are instructed to charge cars to 100% (“full tank”), these rental cars sit here for 45min on average clogging up this supercharger. The rental companies should get their own charging infrastructure installed at TPA. Expect a 15min wait when trying to charge here…"
Terrible terrible always over crowded and the music is getting blasted. Good luck getting a spot to charge.
"Terrible. Very slow charging rate, 50kwh. Then it went all the way down to 1 kWh. Must be defective."
Terribly difficult to get to off the interstate. Many lights and in a busy Target / Meijer parking lot. Tucked in next to a large CCS charger. Cincinnati really needs additional supercharging options.
Terribly difficult to get to off the interstate. Many lights and in a busy Target / Meijer parking lot. Tucked in next to a large CCS charger. Cincinnati really needs additional supercharging options.
Terrific spot.  Chick fil a is a short walk.  Plenty of other good looking food joints.  Super convenient for the airport.
"Tesla = 5th Floor

Parking garage will charge you to park unless you buy food or something to validate your ticket."
Tesla and Google have not added this 250kW Supercharger to Maps officially. Good location and not too far off I-95 and I-4 but lots of local traffic. Located in the Target parking lot.
Tesla charge is not telling the true about is service. The system said 267 miles in full 100% charge unfortunately for 155 miles I putted 195% the price is more than regular gas cost.
Tesla charger - saw 36 kw charging speed
Tesla charger added 38 miles  in 1 hour with its 220 volt / 40amp service.  It's an official Tesla home charger.  Food and drinks were great while we added over 50 miles of charge in a little over 1:15 of charging.  We charged a 2021 Tesla Model Y. Highly recommend!
Tesla charger in Longmont CO. Convenient. Across from Sol19Yoga
Tesla charger is broken and GE charge slow
Tesla charger is located behind the restaurant. It goes upto 10kw.  There's one in the front of the restaurant that is for other EVs and that is much slower at 5kw.
"Tesla Charger located on side of  building.
Multiple restaurants within walking distance (Harris County BBQ, Black Bear Diner, Toro Japanese, Chilis, Mamacitas, IHOP)"
"Tesla charger not working as of Oct 16, 2022. Road assistance closed. Super frustrating. Plan charging earlier and don’t rely on this one."
Tesla charger too damaged to use. General Electric charger worked using the adapter included with the car.
Tesla charger worked perfectly.
"Tesla charger. Meijers. What more does a traveler need? Food and restrooms available in the store. The Meijers itself is a ways back from the road, but the charger is easy to find."
Tesla chargers at Hy-Vee are a great idea. Hy-Vee carries most of your needs and always puts the chargers in a premium location. This one will get used more for our northern trips
Tesla chargers conveniently located like always.
"Tesla chargers should be located around convenient stores and fast food not in a hotel parking lot unless you plan to spend the night. I stay in my car as I'm not comfortable going into a hotel to use their restrooms. Or walk 15 min to the nearest grocery store, coffee shop or restaurant! This would've been best if in the Whole Foods parking lot or the shopping complex across the street. It takes longer to charge (150kwh) at this location. It's always full or couple of them out of service. Also, it's surrounded by bushes and in the back of the hotel parking lot ... safety concern at night. Desperately needed one on Greenville, hence the 3 star."
Tesla chargers work.  That is it.  This one topped out at 220 kWh with our Y at 14% state of charge.  We only need to charge 10 minutes to get home with 25% reserve.
Tesla charging ar a hotel.  Trash can and bathroom all hours of day and night
Tesla Charging only!
Tesla charging only!
"Tesla charging port is broken as of April 5, 2023"
Tesla charging station. Palm Beach outlet mall. Cars and coffee car show once a month here
Tesla charging stations are in a good location near to Groceries shops and restaurants. People can put their vehicles on charge and go shopping or dining. Parking spot next to mattressfirm store. It's in the corner not disrupting on going traffic and the individual stations are well spaced out.
Tesla Cyber Truck scouting mission! Can't wait till I can charge up here!!
"Tesla destination charger only emits 8kw. The charge point one doesn’t work. Town has limited chargers so this is about as good as it gets. I suggest if you need a charger to go back home later, come here during the day and leave it for a few hours. Our model 3 will take 4hr to charge to 97% from 30%."
Tesla destination chargers gone.
Tesla has built this Supercharger in a spot where Gas cars are taking up most of the charging spots. I have personally seen Tesla car owners arguing with non EV car owners to move to other open spots but they will not budge. I have heard many people getting in fights from people around and this is not a good situation. Tesla should clearly indicate the spots are “for charging only otherwise cars will be towed” to deter gas car users from parking in charging spots.
Tesla has charger as available. This one in Fargo ND is down. Now I have to spend half a day at a charge point to get to the next charger
"Tesla has EIGHT parking spaces at this location. As a hotel guest, I arrived late at night, and these were the only convenient parking spaces available. While I am happy to be courteous of the special needs of electric car drivers, it seemed reasonable to expect that there would not be EIGHT teslas arriving after ten pm that night, in need of charging.

The next morning I found that the driver's side window of my car had been VANDALIZED by a tesla employee/representative.

Clearly, these parking spaces are being leased by tesla from the hotel, so tesla is exerting its property rights. That's fine, tesla, but HOW ABOUT POSTING A SIGN WARNING THAT YOU WILL BE VANDALIZING MY CAR IF I PARK IN YOUR PRECIOUS SPACE? Really lousy corporate citizenship; but who among us is surprised by this behavior from tesla? You'd think that a company with so much expensive equipment sitting un-monitored at thousands of locations around the country would be careful about promoting vandalism. Yes, I parked in your precious parking space, tesla; but you went completely Putinesque with your response.

To be more precise: those parking spaces are not parking spaces: they are charging spaces. Even a tesla owner may not park there for FIVE MINUTES after the conclusion of charging, or tesla will start billing their account a trespassing fee. I cannot make this stuff up: go to their website for confirmation. Now, on top of having my car vandalized by this corporate miscreant, I feel the need to count myself fortunate that i was not also charged a trespassing fee.

In Teslaworld, there are two kinds of customer: tesla owners; and The Enemy. And even tesla owners must remain on their best behavior, or face punishment. I can only imagine that the rest of the tesla customer relationship must be quite self-affirming for low self-esteem Masochists.

You need not trouble yourself, tesla, with the concern of ever having my business in the future."
"Tesla is the gold standard for charging your EV that has met the test of time and reliability.  I know when they open their chargers to other vehicles, it will be better for Audi E-tron and others using the CCS plug ."
"Tesla is the place to go to see the line of new cars they offer. The sales people are great and friendly. I was there to check out a car for a person who is handicapped. He fell in love with the cars they offer. However, very pricey as they should be for the quality of car it offers."
Tesla just love it
Tesla map has the wrong route. It's behind the Tim Hortons
"Tesla map in car says this location is temporarily closed. But we drove to it after filling up in Giddings and found that it is open and all of the charging pods work.

Hope this helps someone else"
"Tesla map says 4/12 available, the 8 original 250kW chargers are all powered down, some temporary 72kW chargers are powered up further into the parking lot but with no lights on.

Handshake took a moment longer than usual, but it started charging fine. Same Tesla connector."
Tesla map says it's 250 kW but the charging speed is hardly 40kW at 110 mi/hr that's too slow.
"Tesla navigation did not lead me to the parking garage where the chargers are located. I drove around for a while until I could physically see the chargers but I couldn’t see a way into the parking garage other than going the wrong way on the one-way street. Which is what I chose to do.

Since it’s an airport, there wasn’t anything to do, although there is a bathroom, and the information desk where you can get your ticket validated."
Tesla need more supercharger locations. Don't bother with the slow charge Tesla locations. This supercharger location was great and convenient. But Tesla please invest in ALL SUPERCHARGER LOCATIONS cause people be in a rush lol
Tesla needs to add more faster chargers (72kw) or at least a few super chargers (150kw+) on the island of Puerto Rico. After two years the infrastructure is just terrible.
"Tesla needs to add superchargers to all Buc-ee's especially the one in Terrell, TX."
Tesla parking & charging. Comes with private back entrance into casino.
"Tesla please - these chargers are only working at 32-64 kwh average ! Its
a great location if your on low energy, but not if jn a time crunch or on a schedule"
"Tesla really needs to invest into a new charging station north of Houston I-45 between Huntsville and this location, maybe Conroe/Woodlands will be ideal.

Waiting in line for 2 hours. 8 cars waiting in line."
"Tesla reps were on site giving test drives of models 3 and Y. Drives were scheduled in advance but they also offered to anyone who drove up.
New center console on model 3 is nice."
Tesla rocks!
"Tesla should shut this place down. It’s barely a Supercharging station at 49kw (204/hr). Plenty of fast food options close by but most require crossing very busy toads w/ no crosswalk, Wendy’s entrance is only 200’ away. In these Covid times forgot about any nearby open bathrooms. Your better off heading to the 150kW Superchargers at Breezewood (44 miles to the east) or North Huntingdon 37 miles to the west) if traveling along the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76)."
Tesla sucks
Tesla super chargers are amazing
Tesla supercharger here was great. No problems or wait. Wish they had others South and East of downtown. Starbucks and Quaker steak are walkable food options. 2 trips there and we've done both.
"Tesla supercharger in a dimly lit empty parking lot close to the highway, across a Holliday Inn Express,a Mad Boar restaurant and 3 minutes walking distance from a gas station. Eight stalls available and also two standard ChargePoint chargers, one Chademo and the other Combo connector."
"Tesla supercharger in Temple TX at Buc-ee's

This place is so big and conveniently located right next to the freeway. I haven't seen this many supercharger stalls located anywhere else."
"Tesla supercharger is in a great location.  But it was very busy, not a speed charger, packed, only got a limited charge.  It would have taken 1 hr 30 min for full charge.  We went to the next station in Madison, charged a quick 60% in 16 min, then went home."
Tesla supercharger near mall. Recommended. Shopping while you’re charging your Tesla car for 35 minutes. Will comeback again later someday
"Tesla supercharger station it’s on Milwaukee Avenue., on the back parking lot of Woodmans it’s kind of hidden because it is on the side of the main entrance, it is super convenient while I shop my groceries at Woodmans.. I can charge my Electrical vehicle and the best part is they have 12 charger station and they is always plenty of free space for charge my EV. :) , I recommend this Tesla supercharger station 100% ."
Tesla supercharger that is open to guest and Tesla's only 3 of ten stalls were usuable as the rest had ice cars double parking. There is no convince store nearby or any public restroom so yeah this spot is really horrible.
"Tesla Superchargers and the charging experiences are always awesome. My video shows a woman hassling with a non Tesla charger for several very cold and windy minutes while in contrast I was able to hop out into the wintery cold, plug in my Tesla, and hop back into my warm car in about 10 seconds all in."
"Tesla Superchargers are pretty much the same. This Supercharger site is in back of a Royal Farms. It's right along the main road so it's easy to find. My car charged very quickly. I recommend this Supercharger for people going to and from the beach.

Used it again today on the way home from the beach. It's blazingly fast."
Tesla superchargers at a Bucees what’s not to love!
Tesla superchargers at Sheetz are always a winner.
Tesla superchargers available on the parking lot between the Best Western hotel and Topaz Lake Super8 with restaurant and casino.
"Tesla supercharging station located right off the freeway near a target. Easy entry and exit points on my drive up to the Bay Area.

Convenient location and it has ample stores around it so you can preoccupy yourself while your car is charging. There are about 25 charging stations available in the lot sharing the parking lot with the Target. Very well lit at night and it felt safe enough to come charge at midnight."
"Tesla Superstation in Quartzsite Arizona. Located off the north side I-10. This particular location has 36 stalls able to supply 250kW.

Located behind the Carl's Jr. Clean parking lot, trash cans provided like most Superstations. Current cost is currently a flat 41¢ per kW."
"Tesla Superstation located on the south side of I-8. Quick and convenient. Eight stalls with a 250kW capacity. Has never been overly busy any time I've stopped here.

Food, bathrooms in the store."
Tesla wall chargers. Full 48amp. Fantastic
"Tesla, but not a supercharger. Looks inhospitable. (See pic of hazard cones blocking access.) Very slow. Live and learn to check reviews BEFORE detouring here."
"Tesla, please don't list 32 amps as a super charging station. Really eight hours for a full charge?"
"Tested at 253kW on Sep. 10 2022, stall 1A.
Great lighting. Arch II is a short distance across the parking lot, has pizza and bathrooms, and is open 7 days a week: Sun. to Thu. until 1am, and Fri. & Sat. until 2am."
"Thank God for a super charger! Very windy and we almost didn't make it from Deming, NM. Easy access. Worked great. Stall 2A have us 300+ mi/hr. Not a lot of choices for eating. Holiday Inn had clean bathrooms and friendly staff. On to Tucson."
Thank goodness for the supercharger here! Not a lot of opportunities to charge between here and Lincoln City. Beautiful town! Stayed at Bandon Inn and it’s beautiful as well.
"Thank goodness, this facility has been upgraded- to no fewer than 24 chargers ! This is my “local” one, and there was often a line of cars waiting. Since the extra 16 went on line, I’ve not experienced a wait of any kind. 👏👏👏"
"Thank you Avio! Gorgeous area and winery. My only complaint is that the charger isn't higher power, would be great to be 60 amp or higher here."
Thank you BWFSP for adding Level 2 car chargers and Tesla destination chargers.  EV Chargers can work for your business.
"Thank you for adding destination chargers to your location. Makes traveling way more convenient. Chargers are a little tricky to find. They are on the back side of the building, once going down the hill take the small street on your right. This will take you toward the back of the hotel. 3 chargers - 2 Tesla destination chargers, and a regular ev charger. This parking spot even has an entrance to the hotel."
"Thank you for the juice! Nice and fast, as long as you are the only one charging. Otherwise you're splitting 16kW."
"Thank you H-E-B!! Ten, yes 10, charging stations. Great location just off I-10! Easy access and easy to find!"
Thank you Heartland Suites Hotel for providing windshield cleaning fluid and squeegees!  We’ve charged here several times - never crowded - and always filled buckets and squeegees. UPDATE:  even better - we charged at night and it was well lit and we got takeout from guadalajaramexicanrestaurants.com for a parking lot picnic dinner.  That’s the nighttime pic.
"Thank you Holiday Inn Express for another great Tesla Supercharger, we  will have to stay at your hotels more often. We were able to pull in and charge without having to drop our trailer. If you need to drop your trailer to charge there is room for it."
Thank you Holiday World for free charging from Indianapolis!! Great day
Thank you Sweetwater!
Thank you Tesla excellent location.
Thank you Tesla for another charging station. Nice pit stop. There is a gas station with convenience store and a hungry Howies pizza. A hotel and a Dennys is also in walking distance.
Thank you to the Youngberg Hill Inn & Winery for letting us recharge here! We visited the Evergreen air museum and weren’t gonna make it back home so this place saved us. Beautiful area. Inn looks really nice inside. Charger is 240V 32A. Gets us 26 mi/hr in our M3.
Thanks for Tesla having the Supercharger at this location. Almost done with full charging in few min. I am back on road to Charlotte.
Thanks for the free charging!
"Thanks, Andrea!  Without your review we wouldn’t have found the charger."
"The 10 chargers are in the South side of the Pilot express parking lot. One other Tesla charging at 4pm on a Tuesday. Easy access from I-10. Restrooms, convenience store and Subway inside the Pilot express. Stall 3A worked great. All around a good experience."
"the 2 girls working on 10-15-22 at 12:40pm at Starbucks decided (AFTER they rang up close to 50 people) that they didn't want to work anymore, put up a sign saying where to call for a refund on your order & they LEFT🤯this whole travel plaza has the WORST customer service i have ever seen"
"The 250kW super charger locations are fast, efficient, and have plenty of stations. Tesla is the ONLY EV to buy."
"The 2nd bay is broken. The 3rd bay charges intermittently. May want to stay with your car, or watch closely to monitor. Surrounding stores and restaurants are just fine."
"The 3 chargers to the right of the shopping cart is inoperable, as well as the two chargers closest to the light pole on the adjacent side. Operable chargers are only at 20amps"
"The address is ambiguous. As per Tesle website, it stated 5218 Patrick Road, Verona, NY 13478"
"The amount of trash on the ground was ridiculous, maybe add some garbage cans out there and a few picnic tables, a hand washing station to create an ideal atmosphere for a clean environment to rest while charging. A dog station would be helpful so nobody is walking in circles around the poo."
The area is not nice but the supercharger is fast to charge so you don't spend too much time. The food at Wawa is good. I usually buy food and eat it inside the car.
"The area is very clean and organized.
You can find chargers available most of the time and they are very fast comparing to other Tesla superchargers.
I will go there again to charge my car without a doubt."
The area was clean considering I got here after it snowed.  You can't really walk to anything when it's snowy other than the hotel bathroom. The charging station was easy to find. On your way out you can get food and clean your windshield at the gas station (the only time you need to go to a gas station stall)
The attached photo shows all 5 Tesla destination chargers. 3 out of 5 are occupied by ICEs.
The band sucked and the hostess wasn't nice. It's a freaking charging station. Why is this here for review?
"The Beef House Restaurant destination charger was our first experience charging away from home.  When we got there, there was a large wheelchair equipped van parked about a foot into the left space and a Harley motorcycle parked in the right space. While we were trying to decide if we wanted to chance parking in what was left of the space to use the charger the handicapped van occupants came out. Charger supplied 25 mi charge per hour. The meal was wonderful as usual."
"The best electricity you can get in Wendover, hands down. The nearby Chevron has bathrooms that are usable."
The best in the area. No cabin sharing and I’m able to use Sheetz restrooms.
"The best super charger in our 2500 mile road trip!!! 20 stations with 250Kw, with a rough charging rate of 600-680m per hour charging. Nice and clean bathrooms. Burger King and IHOP to meet your hunger needs. Also a dog run facility to give your fur baby a place to run and stretch before the next ride."
The BEST supercharger location on our trip from Gardnerville to SoCal. These things charge INSANELY fast. Best yet there is a taco place literally RIGHT across the street that is absolutely incredible! A must stop for sure.
"The best Tesla supercharger so far!  Buc-ees is finally in the game!  24 Version 3 superchargers.  Plug in and charge anywhere you want no need to worry about separation from the car next to you!  Each car has it's own 250kw to pull.

Bathrooms are the best in the nation!  Run to Buc-ees Masdisonville to charge your car!  Food, bathrooms and convenience store are the best in the country!"
"The Best Western adjacent to the chargers just closed their restrooms to the public. The woman at the desk was INCREDIBLY rude about me asking about the change (restrooms were open right before Christmas). As someone from New Mexico, I’m incredibly disappointed in what a poor impression the hotel staff are leaving on travelers from out of state. I was prepared to buy something from the the hotel snack bar- this is a missed opportunity for the BW to make a little money."
"The bulk of fast charges are still unavailable. I had to wait for one of the two fast chargers at the front of Tivoli, right off Rampart. It was one of those days I didn’t plug my car in at night, so I needed to rely on a quick charger. I would have picked another location. From my car when I selected fast charging locations, it showed 4 available, but to me that’s false when it’s accounting for the slower chargers."
"The Burger King has locked bathrooms and a sign that says Bathrooms are for paying customers only. Welp, they lost my business! Take a short walk to the Camaleon Cafe (walk straight out to main road to sidewalk, take a right and cross the street, go to the yellow building). We literally love the food there and went twice in the same week as it was our favorite dining spot during our 11 state epic roadtrip! They have amazing green chile sauce/soup and reasonable prices!"
"The cable at our stall worked properly but was torn. Also sad to see this amount of littering from other drivers. While there are no trash cans at this location, it’s not hard to keep your trash in your vehicle until you properly dispose your waste."
The cables are great and deluxe electric is provided to your car. I get an extra 300 horsepower when I charge here and it made my hair look better & my car is shinier too. Just kidding. It's a plug you put in your car and you keep yourself busy for a few minutes. It's what's expected at a supercharger.
The cables are very small. One of the charger doesn't work properly
"the cables seem short, the curbs too high. I had to raise my model S D85, and back up until my tires hit the curb guards just to reach my plug. Just another foot longer cable would have been better. There is a gas station across from this with clean restroom and a Subway sandwich shop. No one else was here at 530 pm on a Thursday."
"The car charges at only 87mi per hour and it keeps going down 🤦‍♂️(the entire station is empty, there’s no one other than me). I even tried moving to different chargers, everything is slow"
"The charge was as expected. Sheetz is always a great stop for a charge, restrooms and MTO (made to order) food."
"The charge was quick and up to standard. That wasn’t the problem. The was that there was nothing around the supercharger other than The Spot restaurant.

Also, supercharger 1A was pointless because you couldn’t pull up into the spot. The plants there were out of control! If you really did park there, you leave with some scratches as souvenirs. If there are other spots available than this would not be a problem. Just something to keep in mind."
"The charger I was using broke right after I left. Also costs 1 dollar per hour to park there. Charging is actually semaconnect but is free, just make sure you've got your adapter. Also one of the two spaces is adjacent to a wall so people can't get out from your passenger side of you back in. That's the charger that broke on me."
The charger is conveniently located between Wichita and Kansas City along I-35.  My primary complaint is that it usually seems to want to peak way below expected charge rates even with a conditioned battery pack below 50%.  I've tried moving slots a few times when this happens.  Only once did it ever seem to improve the charge rate.  I don't think the problem is my car since I've seen other V3s work as expected.
"The charger is fine, but keep your doors locked. Some tweeker tried to approach my car and ask me questions but my sister scared him off. Sketchy after dark!"
The charger is fine.  Lots of stores nearby.  150KW max.  The problem is that it is a ways of of the interstate so it costs quite a bit of time to get to it from the interstate and back.  We often charge completely in Jackson so we can make it to Mobile (which is also not terribly convenient to the interstate).
"The charger is great and convenient to the freeway. However, there is *nothing* aside from the Kum & Go nearby–no coffee shops, no food."
The charger is in the Plume Street entrance parking garage on the 4th floor
"The charger is kind of tucked away behind the Hard Rock Casino and you have a couple intersections to get through that are quite busy.  There are 8 stalls here and they are rated for 150KW, however I rarely get those speeds here and average 100KW.  The one thing that is very irritating is that the Casino has placed a speaker at the charging station that has super loud music playing 24/7."
"The charger is only 125Kw, that's why the 4 stars.  On the positive, it's right behind the Culver's, the charging parking spots are painted red and outlined in white, plus it's just right off I-94, and there's a pet area.

Other restaurants nearby include Hardee's and McDonald's."
"The charger is super fast, they say it’s version 3. 50% in a half hour. Highly recommend"
The charger is very close to the highway and everything works. The convenience store for the gas station did not have working bathrooms. The coolers that keep drinks cold weren’t working so I got a hot coffee and peed in the bushes.
"The charger itself is fine and so is the hotel, but the parking lot for the hotel is apparently not large enough to accommodate its guests. We arrived relatively early in the morning to find nearly all of the charging stalls occupied with ICE vehicles."
"The charger kept getting an error code.
If you're not familiar with the town of Charlotte just know that traffic sucks most hours of the day. There are a lot of shops and restaurants so it's got that going for it.
But seriously, if you don't like stop and go traffic, avoid this charging station and move on to Richmond or Staunton.
The chargers are in the back parking lot of the Hyatt Place Hotel."
The charger worked well. Lots of trash in the parking spots. We walked to the Arby's on the other side of the Bo Jangles.
"The charger works well, but if you come after business hours then the women in your car may have to walk a ways or wait till you can drive to the nearest gas station.  And the men should too, but with the double standards I’ve been learning so much about I feel I can mention that there’s a few trees and some grass nearby if you don’t want to wait for a number one."
"The chargers and gas station is nice, but there is so much trash all around it. There’s grass to walk your dogs, but you’re constantly sidestepping all the trash."
"The chargers are accessible via the hotels Valet parking. $10 until 6am. I had to pay 20 to charge from 6pm to 730am. It saved me as the rental car company gave me a car that was not fully charged, but after 12 hours on the charger it only had a range of 41 miles so must be a slower charger. That was up from almost dead.  Update: although I never saw the charger station my guess it was a Tesla only charger, after going both to a tesla and Charge Point super charger in Egg Harbor I found out Hertz did not provide a Tesla adapter and only had 220 and 110 adapters.  The ChargePoint station charged to 100% in two hours for $20 and plugged directly into the Chevy Bolt. That station is a single charger behind hidden sands brewery. You do need their app to pay and start and stop."
"The chargers are all in the back of a shopping center.  A bunch of restaurants in the area, all within walking distance.  Good place for a charge and a meal."
"The chargers are fast!  400+ kw/h.  But, the neighborhood is super ghetto.  Several dudes pan handling next to a boarded up Subway."
The chargers are going to get signs and green spots so they don't get blocked by big pickups and SUV's
"The chargers are great! I’ll give you that!
But IM UTTERLY SURPRISED THAT NO ONE IS TAKING A STAND FOR MORE CHARGERS!!! we need more chargers in slc!!
There’s absolutely 0 chargers in the western part of slc  such as West & South Jordan, Taylorsville, West Valley. Or East such as Park City! Cmon guys! This is ridiculous!
Wait time are over 15min. On top of the charging time. It’s getting ridiculous..
I get that you put these up because it’s near the freeways but think about the people who live in those area too that have to commute minimum 25 min then wait another 10-15 then another 30-40 min just to get a charge!"
The chargers are in the mall parking lot. You have about 30 minutes to charge. After that you would need to pay for being in the parking lot $5.00 that kind of sucks but it is what it is.
"The chargers are in the Sullivan university parking lot, with convenient shopping across the street. Not busy at all, but it was a Sunday afternoon. Could use a garbage can nearby."
The chargers are near the Target and Mattress Firm. Plenty of stuff around.
The chargers are non-operational during the fall and winter when the Inn is closed. All power is shut off to the station.
The chargers are really nice and there's a Taco Bell and a McDonald's I don't know if the Pizza Hut works last time we were here it didn't but the staff at the actual gas station itself are not nice at all but the Caribou was really great and those employees were awesome to talk to
The chargers are right behind me in the pic. The pointed building is the food court/ restroom area. Not too long of walk.
"The chargers are slow this week.
Average is 168km/hr with the top rate being 327km/hr.
I was the only one there and the rate was base line slower than it has been before.
Great location though 😁"
The chargers at Spring Hill suites are too damaged to use. There is one next door at Hilton Tru that works but also appears to have been damaged.
"The chargers itself, are slow. The location however is 5 stars. Love the little liquor store. Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Bathroom was mostly clean. They had squeegees by the Tesla chargers and trash bins which was a nice touch."
The chargers were great and received the expected wattage. They are located in the back of a Holiday Inn. There are convience stores  within walking distance.
The chargers weren't working during my stay. Hotel staff was trying to fix the issue but do not friend on these chargers for your trip.
"The chargers work amazing but the Wendy's it's located at had gross bathrooms, better options would be nice"
"The chargers work great, but the hotel won't allow use of their restroom. They claim Tesla drivers are damaging their facilities. We had stayed at the hotel because the chargers were there. Never again. If you stop overnight, go to the Red Roof Inn across the street."
The chargers worked as expected. The gas station was clean and the staff was friendly. I frequently used this charging station and have never had any issues.
"The charging is good, but the whole lot is very dirty and lots of trash everywhere around. If you come after the restaurant work hours, there’s nowhere to go for restrooms. But during work hours you have 3 places to eat at and 1 fro-yo place.
We have previously charged nearby at Benton, that station was a bit faster."
The charging is nice being by Culver's but I've been here 3 times now and there have been a truck and trailer blocking 2-3 chargers
The charging port is broken! it won't charge anything
"The charging rate was slow, but it was probably because my car battery was cold, even after preheating the battery for 15 minutes"
"The charging stalls are behind the Grand Idaho hotel, at the backmost end of the parking lot, facing the highway.  The hotel has restrooms relatively nearby (closest general entrance to the chargers). There are a few grocery stores a short drive away."
"The charging station is fine, it's in-between Wawa and a Taco Bell/KFC but the Taco Bell/ KFC lobby is closed and Wawa has no tables to sit at so you have to eat in your car."
The charging station works as expected. There is a trashcan there to empty your car trash. The biggest benefit is that there are so many businesses and restaurants right there to be able to do something while your car is charging.
The cheese factory it self was nice but parking lot needs a lot of work and the pumpkin ice crream milk shake was very bad.
"The Chevron next to this location has awesome pastries, charcuterie trays and even a nice wine selection. One of the nicest gas station markets I’ve yet to visit - and right next to the Supercharger. Nice clean bathrooms too."
The clipper Creek is way faster then the tesla charger
The Collin Street bakery has good soup. They also have clean restrooms. There are eight charging stations and we got a fast charging rate.
The customers from wagon wheel restaurant use tesla charging station as a parking for non tesla vehicles
"The diner had a 20 minute wait. So we walked down to a Nirchi’s pizza. It was awesome, a dozen different kinds of pizza. Charge took less than 20 mins even though stalls were half full"
the dirtiest charging station that I’ve ever visited.  There was trash everywhere.
"The Door County Pulse in 2020 had the following information;
Main Street Motel
4209 Main St, Fish Creek, WI 54212
Free for registered guests, Available 24-hours a day
Free for the public, 9am-5pm by appointment only, must register at the front desk
EV Plug (J1772) & Tesla charging station

This option is no longer available to the public.  We have used their tesla charging station before, made a donation and left our cell number Incase a guest needed to charge.
Today we were told no even though they had 5  open charging stations."
The eight chargers farthest from the main road are 250. The closest four are only 150.
"The EV charger at Monarch Mountain works great!  There are two chargers, a J1772 and a Tesla.  Free, thanks Monarch!!  I can also confirm that it's available on the off season if people are there working -- just be back by 4:30 or 5:00 so you don't get locked in."
"The fastest charger from Nashville to Colorado, literally. Fast food and a few gas stations for amenities, all walkable."
"The fastest Tesla supercharger I’ve been too! With 14 charger stations located on the 5th fl, there’s always a spot available to everyone.  Great location, easy to find with GPS/GoogleMap/Waze and surrounded by stores like T.J Maxx, Marshall, Nordstrom Rack, as well as some restaurants. 1.5 hour parking is free with easy validation from those stores. No purchase necessary."
"The first 2 chargers are currently broken. Tesla’s website advertises these at 150kW, but they seem to be 75kW. Plan accordingly. I stop here frequently and the car initially says to charge for 20-25, but once you plug in it will change to 30-35."
The First and only Tesla Supercharger in the Portage/Kalamazoo area. It's a big addition to the city for the Tesla Owners. The location could have been much better. It's tucked towards the right side of the Meijer building. With all the construction going on due to the remodeling of the Meijer it could get a little busy near there. Unfortunately the area is not well maintained with grass growing all over the place and trash being left around the chargers.
"The first I tried didn't work - the second station charged the car quickly. The charging station does get busy, there are constantly cars pulling in and out, so watch out for idling charges. Great location next to the shops - made the best of our wait."
"The first stall that I tried not only didn't work, but it also caused my BMS to freak out to the point that the car said it wouldn't restart when powered down."
The first station on the store side was a problem. Charging halted. Changed to the first station on the street side and no problem.
"The first two I tried were broken, but no signs indicating not to use them 😢"
The food is great here I like come here everyday to charge my Tesla it’s great I recommend you coming here to charge your Tesla
The free-standing charger islands are slower than the stalls.  The stalls are very fast. Bathrooms are a good distance away. The nearby mall is not very busy.
"The future is here!!! Interesting place, close to the highway, where we you can charge your Tesla, while eating something or having an snack. It has like 12 charging stations, and I never seen more than 4 cars over there."
The GPS calls this a 250kw supercharger but we’re only getting 105kw and we are stuck waiting almost an hour for enough charge to reach the next station. Not ideal considering there is nowhere to stay if we decided to call it a night from driving.
"The greatest Supercharger I've seen in 3 years of owning a Tesla.  The first one I've seen with a windshield squeegee available.   After driving through the bugs in June, it was sorely needed.   I didn't take a picture of my windshield before cleaning, but I included a shot of my front fascia.

The charge rate may have been a bit slow, but I was around 60% coming in."
"The grocery store this charger is next to is great! Huge beer and wine selection, nice bathrooms with changing tables, great hot bar, and a nice seating area to eat in. This is a frequent stop for us when we are in the Burlington area, and it’s one of our favorite superchargers."
The HEB has bathrooms and there is food around walking distance takes a bit longer with where the cross walks are but overall a good charger
"The hiking trail by the river is lovely and ends at a large cemetery. Stewart's has pretty great pizza. There's a Thai restaurant right across the road, and a few shops and restaurants over the bridge."
"The Hooksett superchargers are routinely slower than any other site I have been to (and that’s MANY). The northbound side is generally better than the southbound side, but it feels almost as if the maximum charge rate is limited for some reason."
"The hotel appears to be nice.

The charger is located around the back of the building at the furthest point from the front door. Check in up front, get your key, then drive around to charge or you can’t get in the back door as it is locked but opens with electronic hotel key.

The charger is an 8Kwh charger or about 24 miles per hour. It is good if your staying over night. It charges about the same as a 50 amp RV park 15-40 connection. It is not the 16KW I was expecting. I believe the charger has the capacity but the electrician only installed a 50 amp breaker instead of a 100 amp and turned it down.

There are two chargers in the corner of a parking lot at the VERY back. Installation was poorly though out. Instead of one charger for each parking spot they are mounted in the corner of one spot furthest from spot 2, making it difficult to reach the second car.

Neither of the spots are designated electric vehicle.  Making it “not obvious for a ICE vehicle” that it is one of only two electric vehicle charging spots.

When I arrived one spot, the one without the chargers in front of it, was taken up by an Internal combustion engine (ICE) thereby rendering one spot completely inaccessible."
"The hotel folks were super friendly to my great desire to use the lobby bathroom. There are plenty of things to walk to. If you’re terribly empty- maybe even check out the store that is behind the stalls, Northern tool + equipment.

Shake shack, Taco Bell, Walmart and Starbucks also seen. Confirmed that the garbage can is still by the stalls. 👍"
The hotel has 2 Tesla chargers and 1 regular ev charger. I spent $450 on a room here because of the electric chargers and neither telsa ones worked. The regular ev charged at 5kw.
"The hotel has placed several Tesla chargers, which was a key factor in our decision to stay there.  However, all but one were blocked by non electric cars.  Also, there is an unadvertised $10.00 fee for using it."
The hotel informed me that this charger is only for hotel guests so don’t waste your time going here
"The hotel offers a convenient and clean bathroom, but it would be nice if there was a restaurant or two within walking distance. As it is, if you're hungry, pick up some fast food and eat it while your car charges."
The Inn looks like a really nice place to stay while in Falmouth. The Tesla charger is only for anyone who is staying at the Inn.
The intersection into this Hy-Vee needs to be a stop light in my opinion. There's too much traffic for a southbound turn out of it. Otherwise it's nice to be able to grab a quick bite to eat at the stop.
"The joke of electric cars ... too expensive , no range in driving without recharge layovers. Coal powered elecrticity . Someday solar power, but not yet"
"The label 250 KW max Supercharger at this location is misleading. With only 4 cars being charged there,  on a non shared charger 2D, I only got up to 54 KW, and it kept down grading to 44, 13. By noon the charging station was full with only 1 spot left for handicapped person. 2 cars were waiting. Stall 3B, 3C we’re out of service."
"The larger Tesla chargers are older and charge slower, so I don't recommend using those. The newer Tesla chargers worked great! We charged early so there weren't many stores open but there is a Mini Mart within walking distance by the gas station."
"The last parking spots share a charger, almost causing a mix-up with me and another driver.  Shares a parking lot with a Pilot convenience store and a subway to make the time pass quickly.  Very easy to find."
The lights by the superchargers were blinking on and off. A little annoying. Other than that cool place to charge the Tesla. Lots off eats around this shopping center and other businesses as well as a H-E-B.
The lines need to be repainted to align with the chargers and expect there to be non-Teslas blocking some spots. Not infrequently one or more chargers are not working as well. But the presence of a Wawa is very convenient for travelers that are stopping to charge.
"The location (so far away from I-55 corridor) is the main reason for low star rating. It’s approximate 9-10 miles away (east) from I-55 on my way to St. Louis, MO.  Also a very busy charging area. It is too busy actually for my liking. I actually got the last spot upon my arrival. I’ve never seen this before on long trips in the southeastern United States. Tesla desperately needs another in Mississippi just south of Memphis maybe near state line with 12-24 charging stations to be ahead of the future demand. I did like the fact there are several food options Taco Bell and Pf Chang’s to chose from. It is a 150kw charger but charged fast enough to almost fully charge before finishing dinner at P.F. Chang’s. Nice safe place during business  daylight hours a plus to charge there. However high crime area after dark according to locals. Cars did charge quickly when I returned to take off the charger just one car there charging. So a wait might be in store here but hopefully not too long."
"The location is at a gas station on the side of the store not too difficult to find. The five stars I’m giving is because of the easy on and off the interstate, the friendly employees of the store and visited twice and only one other car there. So easy to get in and out quickly with no wait. I forgot to take a pic but there are plenty of good ones here."
The location is easy to find. There's a couple of hotels within walking distance if you need a restroom.
The location is excellent but the charging area is filthy. Either have someone assigned to clean or place a trash bin in the area. Come on people… do better.
"The location is good but not great, speeds to charge amazing.
Location: off a major highway and next to someplace you get food like WaWa and other fast foods.
Speeds: great
Availability: had enough available"
"The location is good, it has really high rates compared with other superchargers. Can access Target from the side stairs."
"The location is in a business center. Lots of shade. Restaurant, Home Depot and Walmart are within walking distance."
"The location is not bad, but the Black Bear restaurant (the owner of the parking lot where the stalls are located) was not very supportive or helpful during our visit.  We stopped here mid morning to find an oversized RV towing a small pickup truck blocking all but two of the stalls.  The restaurant manager left an overly polite note on the RV letting them know that they ""next time"" they should park over on the side of the building, and that these spots were reserved.  The manager said that no one in the restaurant acknowledged that it was their RV.  She said she called the police ""non-emergency line"" to report it.  When I called the police, and asked to have it towed, they said they couldn't tow it without the business owner's permission.  The police told me that they had no record of the restaurant manager having called.  I'm thinking that if that RV had blocked the front door of the restaurant, that manager might have been more proactive.  Tesla needs to figure out a way to prevent this from happening because we drivers seem to be powerless to do much about this kind of situation."
"The location is practical if you have errands do in a pharmacy or supermarket, both are walkable while charging your car.

I had never seen a charging station with a wait before so definitely a popular location."
"The location is terrific. There are three food choices right next to the Supercharger, Vongs Thai, Duncan Donuts and Upper Crust Pizza. We ordered take out from Vongs before we left home and picked it up after we plugged in and ate in the car while we charged, it's really good Thai food so we recommend that anyone who is planning to charge here around a mealtime do the same."
"The location is very good for the quick ChargePoint. It is very close to the interstate. There are not so many food places though, you need to drive a bit more to get to McD or anything. Overall, a perfect place to stop."
"The location of this supercharger it’s got lots of amenities, including restaurants nearby."
"The long awaited V3 supercharger has finally opened here in Kempville, ON! This new supercharger will make my frequent trips b/w Toronto-Ottawa much easier! Arrived here Saturday at around 12:45pm on a long weekend. Only two others here charging. Several amenities around…you will not go hungry here with food all over the place."
"The lot is great. There's many regular and supercharger stations so if you want to park longer you have that option as well. Plenty of shopping upstairs as well It didn't charge us for charging using the supercharger, just the parking fee so it was a great deal. The chargers are in the P2 (lower level) so no issues about space and crowding either."
The mall at this truck island is like an airport terminal! Really great spot for a pee break heading to or from the coast.  I was NOT expecting it to be that good a charging destination.
"The manager at Heartland Inn & Suites was very nice directing me to the restroom and offering free coffee/tea/water and even fresh cookies at 4pm :) and the owners of the hotel got to see the Tesla Semi and pics are on the wall in the lobby, how cool :) and such nice people"
The map is wrong. Drive to the far end of the parking lot. Hotel happy to let you use their restroom. No eating places close by.
The most amazing car in the world its just like a dream
"The nearest bathroom is in the Market Basket which closes at 9PM. There is no sidewalk to the Market Basket, in summer you can walk over a grassy berm but if there is snow on the ground it's going to be a longer walk"
The negative reviews made me hesitant. I got great rates of charge. Consistent 110+ kW but I was alone and it was 7:00 am local.
The new chargers are a little different to get off the station. The old ones you just lift up and then they come off. These you need to yank it out with the might of God.
"The nice trailer bathroom is gone, just a porta potty for the construction crew.  No amenities but good for charging"
"The off-peak charging went from $0.18 to $0.25 in about a 6 month period, if this trend keep up it will cost just as much for gas for me and I would not getting any cost Saving. This price is about $0.36 per kwh. Peak rate are at $0.30 per kwh currently. Currently not able to install home charging (renting) which would solve this problem"
The one I used (2B) was charging at half the rate. Switched to another and am getting the max 150 kWh. Has squeegees!
The one row of superchargers was faulty only about 8Kw charge rate when we stopped around new years '22. Moved to the 4 stalls on the left and got full power.
"The only issues we had with this charging station was our own ignorance. How to open the charging port, how to set the timer, which way to pull in. Fast, easy to use and always spots available. Good job Elon!"
"The only Monopoly super charger in Arlington/grand priare/Mansfield area. Pretty decent charging speed with limited number of cars. Slows down significantly of the lots are full. Good walking trail around a lake.

No restrooms after hours .. and literally no trash cans available."
The only one on town and actually works! Not at 13 but at 6-8
"The only supercharger near Cannon Beach. Right by some outlet malls, so take a stroll and buy some beach shoes."
"The only Tesla charging station in area. Nothing in easy walking distance. One post from two years ago showed a trash can and windshield cleaner, but there is nothing anymore."
"The only Tesla supercharger at the moment near Niagara falls. These are fast chargers. It's not too far from the Fallsview hotels. There is a grocery store and a chicken place named Swiss Chalet. Swiss Chalet is a good place to go if you're hungry, however I highly recommend you check out another restaurant named Casa d'Pizza, which is in the same plaza but takes a few more steps. The food at Casa d'Pizza is very fresh and well cooked. The service there is awesome! They serve more than pizza, too. But the pizza is definitely good. If you're looking for coffee, look for Tim Hortons in the adjacent plaza."
"The ONLY! Tesla charging station in Las Cruces. The other two locations downtown are ChargePoint stations, and ICE guzzlers took two spots. That being said, if you’re in a hurry to charge, El Paso is your best bet."
"The Original! This was the only Supercharger in Houston back in 2016 (1 of 12+ as of 2022), and the first place I saw a Model 3. Cannot wait until I spot my first Cybertruck here! Sometimes a line would form when there were only 6 stalls so always check your maps first before routing to see if there is a less congested location. 🤘"
"The parking deck charges, but it’s free under 30min."
"The parking lot charges a fee, which can add up over time, especially for those who need to charge their Tesla frequently. Additionally, the charging speeds at this station are slow, which can lead to longer charging times and waiting periods."
The parking lot has raised its price and it is free parking for 30 minutes only.
"The Peabody has two Tesla Wall Connectors, but they're behind the Valet fence. If you ask nicely (Charles is the Head Valet), they may charge your car for you even if you're parking in Self Service. But, make sure whomever they send to plug it in or retrieve it knows how to unplug the connector and close the charge port."
"The Peabody Hotel only allow guests to use their Tesla charging stations. Reason being, someone who was not a guest accused them of scratching their car as if guests will not accuse them of scratching their car Smh"
"The people paying for, don't read the signs that state tesla owners don't pay... there are instructions to call via the intercom, and they open the exit, without payment. It's actually very fast, I've never been stuck waiting for the attendant to respond."
The people that use Tesla supercharger must be some kind of lazy because the garbage can is like 10 ft away But they rather litter then throw it away. Should we cleaning up after yourself? Not the Wawa people. It's not fair to them. Just my opinion. I know some people just throw stuff away but not all
"The perfect stop food from the market, fair choice of restaurants, normally more than enough spots to go around for charging."
The pictures don't show a supercharging station here but I can confirm there actually is one there. 250kw/hour
"The place by itself is great. Lots of fun! No complaints. Eat before you go. Food isn’t good at all. No taste, cold, dry. Servers delivered good job. Better grab Wendy’s before."
"The place got  three chargers,two tesla and one charge point. One of Tesla chargers and the charge point charger are not working. The one tesla charger left was connected to a tesla, so I assume it was working."
"The place is constantly full of ICE cars. There are 2 spots that are 30min parking for everyone, the rest are for charging only. That doesn't matter, I was here several times over a couple days and it was always the same. The cars do not care about the signs. There was plenty of empty parking nearby without chargers but walking 10 extra steps would be a violation of their personal beliefs.

As for options nearby, besides the HyVee there isn't a ton around, but I walked to T.C.'s Referee about a block and a half away for lunch and that place was surprisingly good.

As for charging when we were low on battery we were able to hit about 116kW so we had no issues with the actual charging.

Overall, I think that having the chargers further out into the parking lot is a better solution to prevent other cars from parking in the spots."
"The place is good and safe and located near a convenience store. When  using Tesla Super Charger  make sure you are far from any street named ""Martin Luther King Jr."" Those are consistently  in a dangerous  neighborhood   and ALWAYS full of trash from fast food locations, malt liquor bottles  and Gatorade bottles full or urine. These people are  why we can't have nice things!"
The place was empty when I arrived. It showed only 2 of 8 chargers available but I didn't have any problems with the one I pulled into.
"The place was not crowded (the only plus). Otherwise there was nothing nearby to go while you were charging. The road leading here were all covered with potholes and had red cones all over owing to construction. Guess that's still OK as it's temporary. We were here in peak sun (temperature probably around 38°C) and there was no place open to eat, to have water, or to use washroom. Rather than walk more and exhaust ourselves finding anything in the heat, we decided to stay in car and then drive to somewhere instead."
"The rate was really slow (2kw/hr) when I got there, but it was probably because other vehicles were plugged in."
"The repainted lines can result in cars parked unaligned to the chargers. Both I and my brother have experienced slower than expected charge rates here, although in my case maybe only lack of precondition since I went to Subway first after leaving the interstate."
"The rest stop is okay, the charger works really well a few cars show up here it's nice. Very convenient either going north or going south. Works just fine"
"The result of people  going green,travel here then use the city as a garbage can.."
The review by Kim is very accurate. I would add that also in this location there is a Tuesday Morning that allows you to use the bathroom IF you make a purchase. We can’t go into Tuesday Morning without buying something and this store has it all. Very safe location and a great spot to charge before heading into the Sierras
"The second time I've used this charger station, great location, clean, needful travel items are handy.  I have to say that the trailer charging site, 1A, has been blocked both times I have stopped in, once pulling a trailer, she moved after asking her to... just takes common sense."
"The security ppl need to tell the ppl charging their cars to move once they done , ppl just stay there like bro is like a gas station once is charged move ..2 out front and 3 home style in the parking floor"
"The set of four Tesla chargers are 48A while the two Tesla chargers near the building are less amperage, therefore shower charging."
The setup is a little different because you pull into the spots instead of backing in and they are kind of tight.
The Sheetz is busy so keep an eye out when getting to and out of the chargers area as the drive thru is like oncoming traffic. Seating area in the Sheetz lets you keep an eye on your vehicle. Chargers themselves weren't full on the Wednesday evening in the summer when I stopped to charge.  Not much else in walking distance.  Traffic can be heavy to get to and from the Sheetz but convenient location to I-99.
"The slowest charging ever. The highest it ever charge for me is 300km/hr. Even when I unplugged and went to another charger, it’s the same slow charge. I hope Tesla would fix this. The location is convenient. The plaza has Swiss chalet, Food Basics, Dollarama. A 5 min walk to an excellent Vietnamese restaurant at the corner of Montrose and Thorold."
"The Springfield Supercharger is great - fast charging, lots of chargers (though getting busy), and close to restaurants (Outback Steakhouse, Carl's Jr, McDonald's).  The most difficult thing about the location is when exiting, there's a lot of traffic and since you have to get into the far left lane to get into I-5, it can take some time to make that turn safely."
"The staff at the Holiday Inn express was kind and pointed us in the direction of the restrooms. There’s a Dairy Queen across from the chargers, if one needs food/drink."
The stalls are in the back left by the carwash. The gas station is clean and spacious.
"The stalls are new, the charge rate is fast, however it should not cost nearly 8 times as much as charging at home. Taking road trips and charging at this price is going to make electric cars cost MORE than gas. The average commercial price of a kilowatt is $0.09/KwH in warsaw, so why is it most than 4 times as much? $25 to go from 15 to 80% is outrageous when it costs me $3.70 at home, or FREE at other chargers. At the very least put off peak rates and stop gouging people."
"The starwhip was here.

9/10 good poop spot — walk across the street to the White House for a burger."
"The Station #49, the plug is not charging at a fast charging rate, around 160 mi/he at 6 kwh,  car didn't seem like it was fast charging, I changed to station #42, immediately faster +13kwh, that's really frustrating having my time wasted, waiting for a fast charge that isn't."
The station being on the top floor of the garage and with no visible signs on the bottom makes finding this place not obvious for 1st-mers.   There were two slots open but one of them had a physically broken station which should have been fixed or marked as broken before I parked next to it.
The station was busy or clean well-organized the staff was friendly helpful everybody at the charging stations seem to be in and out  quickly well I was there for 20 minutes taking a rest for my ride there was at least four or five calls that I've gotten charged and were on their way in that time
"The super charger was fine, but the area is not that great. The roads are rough, and the Sheetz that it was located at was OK but the restrooms were not the greatest. The grass where I had to walk my dog was not all that clean either."
the super charging station works as expected. The only thing I don't like about this location is that it has very low lighting at night and its behind a plaza. You all most feel detached.
The superchaegers are located in the parking lot of a hotel. Not a very busy location for a Friday evening. There is McDonalds close to the supercharger.
"The Supercharger at Whitemarsh, MD is a second generation Supercharger. It’s fast, but not nearly as fast as the newer Superchargers.

If you're driving along I-95, I recommend that you skip this Supercharger unless your battery is extremely low on charge. In that case, it charges very fast. Just charge enough to get yourself back on the road. When you see the charge rate start to slow down, just stop charging and get back on the road. You'll get quicker charging at virtually any other Supercharger in the I-95 corridor."
"The Supercharger delivers as expected, though it could have been better placed.

To reach the chargers, take the first left-turn into the parking lot from Iron Point Road and then turn right again to enter the parking lot. The four parking spaces are along edge of the lot near Iron Point Road, but roughly in the middle of the lot between the the first and second parking lot entrances.

The location could be better. There is no overhead cover against rain and sun, and nothing above eye-level to indicate where in the parking lot the chargers are located. There's no sidewalk nearby and the short charging cables mean you have to park nose-in and cannot pull through when leaving. The rightmost two parking spots are the most convenient - they back onto an aisle between rows of cars, while the two spots on the left are across from a curb and row of cars, which gives you less space to back out.

The Folsom Premium Outlets are convenient if you are traveling Highway 50, less so if you need to get back onto I-80. The outlet mall is extremely focused on clothing, so options for spending time there while charging during a road trip are limited. Most of the dining options are fast food and most are across Iron Point Road."
"The supercharger facesHannaford supermarket. Right off the highway to Conway, NH. The speed is good."
"The supercharger is at a mall. Got here one night and there were no bathrooms or food, was only able to charge. Also had to enter parking garage in order to use the charger,which is a paid thing"
The SuperCharger is behind the Wawa. This is a good place to charge. Clean bathrooms. There are 8 chargers and the location is close to the interstate.
"The Supercharger is fine, fast, fairly new, rarely full.  It's in the far corner from the doors to the Meijer grocery, closest to the highway.  Plenty of room to walk the dog, or have a picnic."
"The supercharger is fine. It’s in a parking lot for a museum that is never open, the public restroomS are locked. The hotel next door does not have a working public restroom ever and the restaurant across the street requires purchase and is not so friendly. There are few options for amenities at this stop"
The Supercharger is great at 250kw.  The Casey's bathroom isn't that well maintained both times I passed through this week.
"The supercharger is great. High Kwh capacity, and right before the big hill climb to black mountain. That said, the area has nothing aside from an old gas station and run down DQ. Once there is some additional development here though it will be a great charging stop."
The supercharger is located within walking distance from five guys and many other stores. You can just lock the car while is charging and go and eat. Great location and safe
The supercharger only has 7-8 spots and is always very busy. We spent 15 mins on a faulty supercharger and it took forever to charge. The location isn't that great either.
The supercharger station is in the parking lot of brand name outlet. You can kill some time there by window shopping. There are two fast food places and a car wash on the opposite side. As others pointed out I didn't receive 250 KW. Mine was around 61 KW.
"The superchargers are located nearby many amenities, not the least of which is a clean restroom and coffee found at the nearby Starbucks. The Marriott is also a nice place to relax with its spacious lounge and nice views of the Elk river.
As of the beginning of 2023 stalls 1A and 1B seem to be charging at half power."
The Superchargers at Tenaya Lodge we're not functioning for the whole week so this Supercharger in Oakhurst might be a place for you to top off before heading into Yosemite Valley.
The Superchargers that are in an island on the parking lot are the 250 kw chargers that you will want to plug into the chargers that butt up to grass are only 150kw
"The superchargers themselves are fine (though only 150kwh) and Embassy Suites are fantastic!  Getting to the area right now is a nightmare.  There is an unmanageable amount of poorly planned construction on the highways in the immediate area.

There is a charger configured as a pull through, but you can't actually pull through."
"The Superchargers were great, very fast speeds, for a 40%SoC. The location was a little suspect at night if you were alone, with that said, we went there twice while staying in Shreveport for a business trip, other Tesla owner showed up each time which makes people more comfortable.

Only real complaint was a fellow tesla owner dumping their trash out there door. They did have a very sweet dog they let my wife pet, but still throw your trash in a can.

I would stop here again.

Model S
P90D"
"The temporary fencing they have put in for the festival in the parking lot is _rediculous_ this year; not only does it eliminate three Supercharger stalls, but it makes it virtually impossible to pull into the last few stalls because there's not enough room to maneuver to back in or get out. It's even hard to get in and out of the other stalls due to how close the fencing is. Tesla got the short end of the deal on this and needs to negotiate better terms next year!"
The Tesla charger charge at 23 to 25 miles per hour.
"The Tesla charger is inside the Lodge garage and only available for guests. It's not a Supercharger. Unlike the other comment, I was not offered the opportunity to pay to use it. I had no choice but to book a room, which is expensive. Be mindful of this in your planning."
The Tesla charger is working fine. The place is a little scary and I wouldn’t want to get out if I were here by myself (female).  Choose another supercharger if you can.
The Tesla charger was broken. GE wouldn’t charge my car.
The Tesla charger was not working on 3/9/19 but the other charger next to it was working.  Worked well for an overnight charge but only one car can be accommodated due to the charger location.
The Tesla chargers did not work we had to use the EV charger.
The Tesla charges at Doubletree in Durango are out of service. The universal charger only puts out 6kw. It took 15 hrs to change. There went our trip to Silverton.
"The Tesla Charging Network is Second to None. The Best,  hands down. The car batteries and driving distance need to double to completely replace ICE."
"The Tesla destination charger is at the basement of the hotel here and is only free for hotel guests. Outsiders can use it for a day by paying $20 as a fee or by spending $25 at hotel restaurant or their other services.

The charger is kind of hidden away, with an automatic basement garage door that opens only when you approach it driving in.. there are no sign boards outside. Of the two chargers there, one is Tesla and the second is generic EV charger."
The Tesla destination charger is not active and the other charger works but is way in the back in hotel only entrance. Hard to find.
"The Tesla Destination chargers and EV charger are working great; unsure what A.P. means, as they are good to go."
"The Tesla directions will take you RIGHT when heading West on North St.  This is wrong, you go into the garage on the LEFT.  Chargers on 3rd level.  Back in till your tires hit the curb (raise suspension if you are that nervous), cables are short."
"The TESLA EV Supercharger is In the parking lot of Marketplace foods.  No coffee in the store, but it’s a nice store with everything else you’d need.  Clean restroom.  (There’s a Starbucks or gas stations within walking distance for your coffee!). If you have time to enjoy a meal or cocktail after charging, check out Jake’s Supper club just 10 minutes away."
The Tesla navigator took us to a Walmart down the hill. Had to Google the charger to get to the right place. Charger is much slower than most. Watched the Sheetz employee use plastic gloves to pick up trash then went behind the counter to finish a sub. I'll bypass this stop on future trips.
"the tesla supercharge is dirty, people that charge trash the place.
Tesla drivers PLEASE dont leave your garbage at the supercharger sites"
The Tesla Supercharger is out of this world! It's like plugging your car into a magic portal and suddenly you're fully charged and ready to take on the galaxy. Highly recommend for anyone looking to go on a intergalactic road trip!
The Tesla supercharger network is always awesome. No complaints here.
"The Tesla superchargers in this location are tier 2 and only go up to a maximum of 75kw.

Charging rates have changed as of 11/15/2022. $0.27 kWh no longer exists at these Tesla superchargers. Pricing is higher during peak hours and lowers during off-peak hours

The only benefit to this location is that there are a total of 19 Tesla Superchargers which is more than any other location in NJ/NY. There are also an additional 2 non-Tesla EV chargers.

This location wouldn’t be too bad if it wasn’t for the garage fee which is a minimum of $4. It’s no longer $3."
"The view is amazing and there are nice amenities nearby, but the wait was 5 cars deep with every charger filled when I arrived.  It probably took me over 50 minites between the wait and charging.  Not.  Okay."
The Walden Ave supercharger is in a great location off the thruway in a shopping center.  Cabela’s is a nice store to browse with clean bathrooms.
The West Bay Beach resort had executed this charging station associated with their hotel very well. There are 3 Tesla High Power Wall Chargers and 1 ClipperCreek Level 2 charger in a parking lot island away from the hotel entrance with clear EV-only signage.  It's free to use for hotel guests. Please check with the reception if not staying at the hotel.
"The winery this charger is at is nice, you will enjoy your time here."
The worst speeds ever due to cabin sharing. I was getting 36kwh which is unacceptable. Time to retire it and rewire it Tesla!
"The worst supercharger I have yet used and I've used a lot. Inconvenient. Cramped. Pay after the first hour. Not even a V3 charger. No bathroom available. No food or drinks nearby. Dark and gloomy

Just all the worst things a supercharger could be.

Tesla really nailed the experience here as in every aspect of their vehicles."
"The worst supercharger in the USA.

With less than half the stalls taken we were only getting 71kWh/250mph

Since it takes so long.. You also have the privilege of paying the garage for parking fees ($2/hr, $2min).

If you can avoid this one on a road trip… stop in monument or Trinidad

Or find a hotel in CO springs that has a free charger. Shoutout best western plus for the free charging

EDIT: back again, just as bad as last time. Added pic"
The X Games were going on and I guess they were blocked until some Tesla owners made them aware of the need to charge.  Still somewhat blocked but at least some are open to charge.
"There are 10 chargers here, and they seem to be very quiet. Not many restaurants close by, but Meijers has food and restrooms."
"There are 12 150kw superchargers and several 250kw superchargers, plus other EV chargers.  Love that the superchargers are parallel to your car when parking (versus perpendicular). Watch for the other people driving very fast on this road."
There are 12 stations at this location but the parking spaces are narrow. It's tucked away in the Courtyard Marriott side parking lot so you need to go up into the Courtyard Marriott to get there. The views are beautiful here so it's a lovely place for a stroll while you're charging.
"There are 150kw and 250 kw chargers; make sure to look for the thin cords (for faster charging). Late at night, when Chevron closes, restrooms may not be available."
"There are 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 2A, 2B not sure if it went higher than that"
There are 2 clipper creek free charging stations for the J type plug like my Chevrolet.   They are right next to the Tesla chargers.
"There are 2 stalls, located in the holiday inn parking lot, on the side near dairy with.  Doesn't seem to be very busy."
"There are 2!! Chargers not working and a mini van that is taking up 2 places to charge, so 4!! Chargers not able to be used. Our understanding is that the mini van has been here for 2days. Who should be called to get this charging station back up to par???"
There are 20 chargers here with only 4 in use when we visited. The Tesla supercharger in the mall parking lot
"There are 3 free Tesla only superchargers. The one closest to the building would only charge at 8kw (car reported a connection issue) but the others are 12kw, 240V, 48A."
There are 3 plugs here. The middle is the fastest of the 3 at 29mi/hr 48/48A . Quiet spot. There are a few restaurants & shops  that are in a not completely safe to get to but still manageable.
There are 4 destination chargers that run at 6 kWh. Really great experience
"There are 4 separate hookups (two charging stations with two chargers each), which is pretty convenient."
There are 4 Tesla destination chargers and 2 j1772 chargers.  Very convenient.
There are 4 Tesla destination chargers at this site...likely you will get solar power during the day and because or the excess of solar that is grid tie you can consider your charge footprint free. Operational 24/7. There are also 2 stage 2 std chargers available. Provided by Faith Technologies.
"There are 5 charging station. When I arrived the first day, although there were plenty of parking spaces available,  2 gas operated cars parked in these spots. This morning,  as you can see in the photo, all these spots were taken by gas cars, and there are plenty of available parking spaces. If you need to charge yours, you might have a problem."
"There are 8 250 kw superchargers here.  They are a little hidden, tucked behind the Casey's General store and Dempsey's BBQ, which is open 11-9.  We did not eat there but it smelled amazing and seemed like a great spot for a lunch stop.  We definitely took advantage of the clean bathrooms and coffee at Casey's.  Overall, great location right off the freeway between KC and St. Louis."
"There are 8 stalls here and when I used it, there was only 1 other Tesla. There were no ICErs even though it was tough to find parking. There is a Thai restaurant, a bar & grill and other places to eat. I couldn't find a public restroom although I'm sure the restauarants wouldnt mind letting you use theirs since it seems like a very friendly location. I charged here right after snow boarding at Heavenly before heading back to the Bay Area."
"There are 8 stalls, which are fully functional most of the time. They are located in Irving Gas Station. Diners and Tim Horton are closed by. However, they are not open 24 hrs except for the minimart and washrooms. The area is bright and safe."
"There are a few Tesla Superchargers in the area and on the way to Las Vegas. This one is a littler farther off the freeway, but worth it. They are 250kw chargers, went from 25% to 75% in about 15 minutes in 40 degree weather. They are in the parking lot of the Kingman visitor center and Route 66 Museum. Public restrooms available and Mr. D's Dinner is across the street for breakfast, lunch or diner all day. Eat or check out the museum while you charge up and you can head to Vegas without stopping again."
"There are a lot of super fast chargers here!!  In the time it takes to get a charge, you can run into Buccee’s, they have like a hundred+ clean restrooms, grab chop beef brisket sandwich, Iccee, any even some weird thing u somehow didn’t know you needed!  This place is huge!"
There are four Tesla chargers.  Signs say for registered guests only.  Low power and good for overnight charging only.
"There are four Tesla level 2 chargers and one J1772 clipper creek charger, lots of stores nearby including a Starbucks. A good place to top off and shop around."
"There are indeed multiple chargers here. The price is $0.2/kWh. This is a great stop to ease some range anxiety due to potential crosswinds before heading to Deming, Truth or Consequences, or El Paso for Superchargers depending on your route. We charged to 99% at El Paso in the morning to head for White Sands. We arrived here with 35%. There are bathrooms inside the building on the 2nd floor as well as a free public WiFi network."
"There are lots of good restaurants nearby but they are down the hill from the Supercharger. I'm not sure where you go to the bathroom here. There is a movie theater nearby,  several restaurants and a supermarket. The Starbucks is probably your best bet for a bathroom.

The Superchargers are at the back, up the hill on your left."
There are no charging stations here
There are no trash cans. The brief 5 to 8 min walk to the shopping plaza is really nice it is a 2 min walk to McDonald's or circle k if you can't wait the 8 min walk to get to the better shops and restaurants.
"There are only 3 stalls here. It’s also in an odd part of the lot, sometimes there’s some characters walking around. But nearby is great - a good mall and lots of other food. If you can get a stall you’ll have plenty to do outside your car while charging."
"There are only two chargers, both of which were being used. In contrast to prior posts, I was told the chargers were for hotel guests only so I had to use a charger elsewhere."
There are plenty of stalls very clean and well lit area right beside the target.  My issue is the price is going up! It used to be 19 cents per kilowatt off peak and then 30 cents on peak but now is 25 cents off peak and $0.30 on peak! They also pushed the times back to 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. for on peak!  The off-peak times used to be up to 11:00. A.m.
"There are plenty shops to shop, eat (subway), ice cream …. in the area"
"There are several charging stations located on this lot. I haven't used any of them but it seems to get a good amount of ""traffic"" with cars getting charged up. They seem to be well maintained and some day who knows, maybe I will make use of them myself."
"There are six chargers here. At least two of them are defective. I spent an hour trying to charge at one, and managed to add about 100 miles of charge before it generated some kind of network error and turned itself off.

Another Tesla owner had a similar experience at the stall next to me. But he was smarter and tried several different stalls before discovering that 1A, the westernmost charger, provided a normal charging experience.

The chargers are at a Royal Farms convenience store, and if what you want can be purchased there, it's fine. Lots of nearby restaurants, but they are across a fast, dual lane highway and require a dangerous run across the road."
"There are two L2 Tesla chargers and a J1772 charger. The Tesla chargers are working fine. The button on the charger handle didn’t open my charger cover, so I used my app, and it’s charging fine as I walk around town and get a meal at the Pow Wow restaurant."
There are two Tesla destination chargers that worked great at no additional cost. Two other non-Tesla chargers. The problem is Rocky Gap installed these with no signage indicating the spots are reserved for Electric Vehicle charging only. There were non-electric cars parked in the spots the first day I was there. Extra long cables made charging easy.
There is 14 Tesla vehicle charging station on this area. Everything looks good and running. 👍
"There is a circle k, The Wine'ing Butcher"
There is a clean public restroom in the center of the outlet stores. A car wash is also very convenient. Both are nice features for long distance drivers. I gave it 4 stars because the chargers are only 150W max.
"There is a creep in a white Lexus SUV that watches people while charging here, this is scary and annoying at best"
"There is a dc fast charger, many stage 2 chargers all 24/7 and best of all free ...and sun powered ...especially during the day. This is the best place to charge in the state ...dc fast charge is currently spring 2019 $3."
"There is a destination charger here, but it is in the Ritz Carlton. You have to pay for parking and the valet has to bring it down."
There is a good shop where one can use the restrooms and buy food and wine. We actually ordered take away dinner at Taj E India Vermont and came to top up at this supercharger in NH across the river.
There is a lot of construction in the area. The Tesla GPS does not really get you there. You have to improvise. Charges are located in the Holiday inn parking lot. Nice clean bathrooms nice lobby lounge area.
There is a lot of drug activity at this location.  Dealers standing in front of the Kum & Go and obvious addicts roaming around.
"There is a lot of traffic in the area so it may be confusing to get in. Once you get in, there are a lot of shops to visit while charging. This charger is also incredibly quick - ours was charging at 1000 mi/hr with 3 other Tesla's charging at the same time!"
"There is a porta potty close by if you need a restroom ASAP - otherwise it’s a short walk through the parking lot to the waterfront side with breweries and coffee shops, and a beautiful green space. Newer development area doesn’t have great signage so you have to wander a bit to find food/drinks, restrooms but it’s a beautiful area for a longer stop!"
There is a total of 3 Tesla destination chargers and 4 SAE J1772 chargers.
"There is a very good Japanese restaurant next to it, Hibachi express"
There is actually no charger here the closest in inside the parking garage and there is 1 tesla outlet. It was very slow
There is also a clipper creek level 2 charger station adjacent to the Tesla station
"There is also a non Tesla charger. Totally free, totally awesome."
There is an outlet mall with a food court and restrooms. I'm not sure if the restrooms are open during non-business hours. There are vending machine inside as well as outside.
There is just one charging point. It's by the ground floor parking garage of DoubleTree hotel. It's free to use but charges very slow.
There is no ChargePoint charging station at this location. Many Tesla chargers but if you don’t have the adapter and have some other non-Tesla ev you’re totally out of luck.
There is no charger at this location (09 Sept 2021?
There is no charger here
There is no charger here!! Wasted around half an hour in traffic to get here.
There is no garbage can next to the chargers.
"There is no super charger here, nor is there any sign remaining that there ever was."
There is no Tesla charger here. Just the one shown in the other picture.
"There is not and never has been a charge point station at this location.
There are 2 tesla trickle charges. The 9ne one the left is not working.the one on the right does. And down the road are some super chargers."
"There is now 2 chargers here, both are Tesla chargers.  They are located in the first and second parking spaces near the lobby entrance to The Abbey resort."
There is one Tesla charger (in working condition) located in the back of the parking lot of the Spring Hill Suites hotel.
"There is only 1 supercharger on the entire Mississippi Gulf Coast but several of the casinos offer free destination chargers. This one is conveniently located on the 2nd level of Harrah’s parking garage, immediately to the right of the main hotel entrance. Four bays with 2 pedestals: 1 Tesla and 1J1772. One Tesla plug was out of order when we visited. Clean, secure, and close to food and nice restrooms. You can also gamble if you prefer. We had a nice dinner and added 60 miles to our charge.  If you use the first bay be careful of the exposed fixtures overhead. A Tesla Model Y trunk will hit them if opened."
"There is only one charger. It is operational, but very slow and hard to see.   The location is why I gave it 3 stars because there are many little shops in the downtown area and the landing that you can spend a few hours shopping and/or at a restaurant."
There is plenty of parking available if you are towing a trailer and need to drop it. We were able to charge without dropping our trailer which was a plus for us.
There is plenty of room at this supercharger for towed vehicles. We were lucky to be there when it wasn’t busy so we did not have to drop our trailer but there was plenty of room to drop a trailer if it had been necessary.
"There just isn't any comparison to the speed, reliability, ease of use, cost, and availability (stations and stalls) of the Supercharger network. Sheetz always has clean restrooms and you can grab a quick MTO bite if you're hungry."
There out here folks.  Now get e vehicle
"There really isn’t a safe walkway between the Tesla stations and the Target/other stores nearby. Doesn’t affect me, yet, but the area isn’t handicap accessible either. Chargers still work great though."
"There really should be more of these, They are great and the stations look new and very nice looking."
"There was a line, but I only waited 10 mins. There's no restrooms or a convince store, your best bet is the nearby movie museum. Unexpected benefit is the amazing view of the mountains ⛰️"
"There was construction at the corner space in the plaza and they blocked the charging station with their equipment 😒
Also there is only one port and it is a slow 8 kw."
There was no restroom beside from a bad porta potty. Charging was extremely fast though. Finished around 170 miles in 20 minutes. Still construction under progress and no restaurant or buildings near by.
There was not too much cars there. The location is really convenient. You have several store you can walk in while charging your tesla.
"There were a lot of charging stalls at this supercharger. There were no trash cans or windshield cleaners (typical). It was also a way away from a bathroom or food. If you just need a charge and peace and quiet, you are in luck."
"There were like 6 other Teslas charging here just now, so I assume it’s working (mine is charging, station closest to the green power box). Decent location, plenty of walking options."
There were no cars there when I pulled in at 5:30pm so that was convenient. There was a trash bin which most don’t have BUT it was very expensive compared to others I’ve used in CO. A quick 100 mile boost cost over $10.
"There were open spots and they just work.
Several eateries nearby and in a Meijer parking lot."
There were plenty of stalls to charge at.  As it got close to 4pm it started to get busy with many of the stalls being used.  Easy on and off of 96 expressway.
There were quite a few chargers and it was in a subway parking lot.    We were able to get dinner and charge at the same time.
"There's a convenience store and Denny's for food or a restroom break. There were several empty spaces available when we arrived. The hostess at Denny’s was friendly.
Station 4B didn’t have power."
There's a McDonald's and rite aid next to it. Hines is a pretty small town.
There's about 8 or 9 chargers available and there's plenty of food available within walking distance.
There's always a bay available
"There's Chinese takeout, Duncan Doughnuts (sometimes just drive through), Roses Express (home store), Circle K (across the street), CVS...and McDonald's close by.   Open, clean and relatively safe."
"There's construction around the parking lot and entrance so it's a bit chaotic there, but there are lots of food, drinks, and bathrooms within walking distance. And now we get to Tesla Cache!"
There's electricity here.
There's finally a second supercharger in the Minneapolis area! There are 8 spots and I was able to get 147kW on my model 3 which is a great charging speed. This location also has a window cleaning station and trash can. The chargers that are at Hy-Vee's are always convenient because you can go in and grab a couple snacks while you're waiting.
There's food nearby. If you need extra charging heading West into Great Falls checkout B RV in Stanford. Bring your Nema 14-50 and their 50 amp RV stall can give you 10-20% in about two hours. Talk to owner Bobby and she'll probably let you charge for a couple hours for $10. There are restrooms and laundry at their site too. Although you'll probably make it to Great Falls with 10% left as well but I know people might have range anxiety.
"There's is one Tesla superchargers location in South Padre Island in the parking lot of the Holiday Inn Resort South Padre Island- On the beach. It has 3 operational superchargers stalls at this location, and all 3 were available when I pulled up. There are also 8 level 2 free Tesla chargers located in the same parking lot."
"There's nothing here. In the cold you'll likely need to eat Wawa food in your car. If you're picky, bring your own food/activity/entertainment."
There's really a charger for Tesla
"There’s a destination charger here, just marked in the wrong location on the map"
There’s a diner nearby and some fast food places a short walk away but no super accessible bathrooms. Very busy and slow charging.
"There’s a gate to the community, they let you pass BUT confusing where it’s located. Never found it and turned around."
"There’s always space, it is located in a good spot and every time we need to use it we have no problem."
There’s always spots available when I stop here but I’ve tried a few stalls and have never gotten the full 250kW. Anyone else?
"There’s only one store or restaurant in the parking lot, a Carl’s Junior.  The restrooms in the restaurant were in horrible shape. There are many, many cars charging, and not enough trash cans.

There is a lot of land nearby.  Tesla needs to purchase a parcel and build a charging lounge - ask us to pay a small amount to use it, if you must.  Just do something so that in between two giant metropolitan cities there is a decent place to charge."
"These 250kW chargers gave us a little extra yee-haw ⚡️ 10/10, would recommend 🤠"
"These always work reliably. Note the Marriott Fairfield did not let us use their bathrooms.  I get it, customers only, but kind of annoying when I'm a Bonvoy member.  This place needs another coffee shop to replace the Chapelure Coffee that closed down."
"These are easy to use chargers with entertainment and food at the casino. We arrived on a saturday, and all 4 spots were open. We got a charge rate of about 30 mph, which gave us time to eat and explore the casino. Also check out the Morton Gneiss scientific area nearby with some of the oldest exposed rocks on earth!"
"These are j1772 chargers, as of October 2022. Not Tesla. Which is ok, everyone should probably carry an adapter to connect to either one. $3/hour is not the best price, but the charger seems fast. Required downloading a new app (to me at least) called AmpUp.
An old-fashioned gasoline f150 was parked in the spot, but the cord is long enough to reach me in the next spot over. There is also a NEMA 14-50r four prong plug. That one appears to be free(!?) for hotel guests."
"These are L2 chargers (not DC fast charge), but they are free. One is a Tesla destination charger, and the other is a ClipperCreek standard J1772 charger for most other EVs on the market."
"These are level 3 chargers, meaning they can charge your Tesla very fast. And definitely cheaper then other non Tesla chargers. Just a bit of a drive for some people."
These are not 250kw chargers.  Came here at 5am with zero cars other than mine. Charger was only pulling 105-115 kw.  Yes I pre conditioned.
These are not in this garage.
"These are not locked, other review stating they are is confusing this location with the other one down the road at other hotel."
"These are overnight chargers. But good in a pinch, around Hampton Va, unless someone knows of Superchargers in this area?"
"These are slowish L2 chargers (not DC fast charge), but they are free. There are both Tesla destination chargers and standard J1772 chargers for most other EVs on the market."
"These are the best destination chargers I’ve ever experienced. They charge at 32A, 220V. You can get a full charge overnight at 25 miles per hour."
"These aren't reserved for Tesla cars, or charging at all. If the mall is busy, people are allowed to park there. Unfortunately, that means you really have no way of knowing if there are stalls available since the spot is easily taken without charging so it appears to be available."
These chargers are always close to some shopping center or mall or food so it's convenient if you are going to keep it for 30 min
These chargers are in great shape and conveniently located between a giant Meijer and Target so you can burn time. There are plenty of stations and often has a few open. Most of the other tesla drivers seem to be pretty cool. It becomes like a car meet
"These Chargers are in the Double Tree parking lot. You can't enter the lot without a parking card. I just went to the front desk and told them I have a Tesla and I want to use their charger. They were super nice and gave me a parking card with no questions. The staff was so nice we are considering staying at the Double Tree next time we are in Chattanooga.

Dot expect a super fast charge these are regular wall chargers. I think they were on a 30w breaker because it was charging a little slower than I expected. But a block over there is the pinball meseum that is a cool place to hang out while you charge."
"These chargers are located in the valet parking area which is currently closed (June 29, 2021) so they’re completely inaccessible. Be sure to call before booking to find out if they’re open. Next closest is at a garage at another hotel."
These charging stations are convenient for your Tesla cars and trucks wich is awesome and necessary for the future!
"These Tesla Super Charger are super easy to back up too. This is one of my favorite places to use when I need a charge. There are many stores and restaurants to zip into. Also,  the mall is across the street depending on how long you are charging."
"These things are really fast. I highly recommend, tho, to always navigate to the charging station while it's cold outside. The vehicle should actually recommend this. It'll preserve the battery life while giving the best overall charging."
These were a bit slower than a lot of other stations we’ve used. But there is a TON of shopping and many restaurants. Super safe area about a mile off interstate 75
"They are leaving unattended cars in the charging stalls, this place has 8 stalls and the dealer is taking up 6 of them. Employees unconcerned when this was brought to their attention."
"They changed the peak/non-peak period charges. Check pictures for the new periods. However, there are lots of charging spots and it’s pretty fast."
They charged me 20$ to leave my car charging.
They feed my Plaid’s voracious appetite for power.
They finally fixed an issue that was limiting this charger to 150 kw and it’s not at full speed at 250 kw.
They got the latest wall charger which outputs 48 amps about 40 miles per hour!
They have 250 and 150 kw of charge your choice and it's a big charge station well lit and safe there it's in Meyers parking lot but that is the only one that's close to Joliet Tesla have to build a few of them in Joliet!!!
They have 7 total Tesla destination chargers here!!! They are all around the building. No immediate restaurants nearby but are close enough to walk to so you can charge and get to White Sands National Park and back!!!
They have a garbage and two windshield squeeges at the charger station
They have a voter drop box there. I don't own an electric car and have no opinion on electric cars. So I have no comment on the location other than there's a voter drop off box here as well.
"They have doubled the number of stations in the past year . Dunkin donuts and a Baskin Robbins at the stop, but not much else.

Easy access back to 86 South and 99.

Charger seems to be upgraded to 150kw instead of the 120kw listed on the site info."
They have j1772 too. No just Tesla. Awesome location in town to walk around.
"They have many supercharger stations there but a narrow one way down to the lower level that’s where all the superchargers are. $4 parking for an hour, charging speed is slow, like at 65kw but overall not bad."
they have no clue where and how to charge
They have TAMALES (Marisela’s) it’s a great spot to have a Mexican plate.
They have TAMALES (Marisela’s) it’s a great spot to have a Mexican plate.
They have the fastest Tesla destination charger in the next 100 miles.  18kwh!!
"They have two chargers and the Tesla charger was being used, but they gave us an adapter and we left with a full charge.  The rooms were fine and the breakfast provided was as good as you are going to get during Covid.  Just make sure you call ahead to make sure they have one of the two spots open."
They have two(2) Tesla destination chargers and two(2) J-1772’s.  I didn’t really need to charge but dropped by to check them out. I was only able to test the Tesla one; see the pics below.
They increased prices to $10 an hour for parking  and lowered grace period to 10 min. A lot of cars were charging outside entrance and they built a fence to try to prevent that. I see a few cars still doing it sometimes and can't blame them. From midnight to 8am rates are currently 20 cents per kWh so at least that's a plus but Tesla really needs to work something out with this lot and since these are urban chargers and you get here with less than 20% battery you aren't making it to 90% in an hour which means you have to pay even more for parking.
They just love when you park the 3/4 ton there lol
They let me use the destination charger for testing without being a customer.
They must have fixed the slow charging speeds someone mentioned.  Currently charging model 3 long range at 517/mph. The All American Steakhouse by the chargers is a great place for a tasty snack or a meal.
"They must have had an update to this supercharger. We got the rates speeds of 250 in our Model Y. Trash cans are updated too! We walked to the Cracker Barrel for restrooms, so I can't comment on the hotel. Consider this charger again!"
They need more charging ports. Always packed.
They need to mark clearly these spots as “Electric Vehicle Charging Only” ...  if you’re not accustomed to looking for the charging stations they’re easy to miss. Otherwise great amenity for this hotel!
They only allow hotel guests to use it
They placed it in the middle of the parking lot so you have to deal with the coming and goings of shopping traffic instead of going to a spot out of the way.
They placed them in a bad spot at the wawa they should of been placed on the other side of the wawa....they have so many spots for them and they are never filled and when the fueling tank is there to fill the gas your driving blind and cud get in an accident cuz u can't see around the truck see if someone is there pulling out from charging plus one of the charging spots interferes with the air pump station
They put the chargers on disabled parking spaces....
They really need to fix one side of the lot where there is an awful dip and water just sits and accumulates into a huge puddle. Other than that it's OK safe.
"They were so kind! I wasn’t even staying at the hotel, but they let me charge my Tesla for 7 hours while I was downtown for a friend’s wedding. Very safe, key access parking lot in a beautiful part of Chattanooga. Thank you so much!!!"
They will not let you use the charger if you aren’t staying at the hotel. Even if you pay for parking.
"They work fine. There really isn’t much within walking distance other than the gas station convenient store, and McDonald’s."
They work great and you can get wawa to deliver food to the car which is great when the kids are sleeping but they get blocked by non Tesla's often and there is a lot of strange things that can be seen in that parking lot.
They're broken.  Been broken for months they said.
They're inside the Courtyard Marriott parking lot.
They're very convenient and nice to have almost everywhere I go but why do we have to be so far back in the parking lot y'all to have some green spots up closer to the front
Third floor of the parking garage. Pull a ticket and it's free for the first hour. Tesla Supercharging is very fast: up to 600 miles/hour at nearly 150 kW!
This 12 station supercharger is immediately adjacent to a very large grocery store plaza right off the Orleans rotary. This is a great stop on your way to Outer Cape Cod as you can get all your groceries for your weekend vacation while charging. My car was getting ~100kW :)
This 250 kW charger is not where you think it might be as you drive past the Sheetz where they are normally and head to the back next to Walmart. If you need to use a restroom make sure and stop at the Sheetz on your way in. Same goes for getting food and drinks.  After dark this could be a remote location.
"This a a good fast charger, I believe 350kw, it puts over 550 mph back into my model S."
"This a new Tesla supercharger, very fast. When I arrived passed here on Thursday night, they haven’t painted the parking lines. Two days later it pained!"
"This a relatively new Supercharger as in existed in January 2020, but the convenience store and truck stop didn't open at this location until March 2020.

There's a small park with some sculpture behind the chargers. It's nice, at least in summer. The truck stop/gas station is clean inside, plus there's a little Cafe inside with sit down space."
"This a slow charging station, meant for hotel guests staying overnight. Don't show up expecting a charging station you can use and drive off. It's a ""valet"" service, like parking. (Do I hear Tip Expected?)"
This a very slow charger at home wood suites parking lot. Would only recommend if you are staying here and leave it overnight to charge. 9 hours+.
This a waist of parking spaces. Everyday this store is packed with people and these stupid chargers is the only empty spaces.  Hardly ever a ev using a charger!
This area is so dirty and nasty.  Drivers litter everywhere. The trashcan is overflowing. Nobody wants to wait their turn. Completely uncivilized!!!
This area needs this.
"This at the Kum and Go Store. I was buying scratchers, coffee and cigars. I have seen many cars at the Tesla charging stations, though."
"This bed and breakfast is fantastic! Beautifully decorated throughout, the cleanest rooms, and incredible hosts! Fabulous homemade breakfast with coffee and juice in the morning at a time of my choosing. Comfortable, luxurious beds, very clean bathroom with a large shower. I had everything I needed and more! I will definitely be back!"
"This changed my life. I recently broke up with my dog (married for 4 years) and I had my heart broken, but this helped me get up on my feet. Elon musk welcomed me after I went to charge up my Tesla and shortly after we got together now we are happily married."
"This charge spot is in town. It’s behind a gas station and in a lot between a Walmart and a Canadian Tire.

I’d skip this one if you can. It was a sizeable detour into the city, when there’s the 17A bypass highway. The actual charge spot has no grass, no shelter, no table, no seats. Just hostile concrete and box stores."
"This charger always seems to be full. We have only had to wait once, but it's always busy.

There seems to be few chargers for how big the area is."
"This charger doesn’t exist, or at least we couldn’t find it. ???"
"This charger has been disabled, no charging cords for Tesla or J1772"
"This charger in Sheetz parking is only 150kW, but being next to Sheetz is great ... restrooms, food ... ALWAYS OPEN 👍.  Down the road is a 250kW charger but that plaza closes early so no restroom nor food when that happens, beware!"
"This charger is at the AC Hotel (which are fantastic) Inside they have a best in class breakfast, including Nespresso. Charge your Tesla as well as your pallette..."
This charger is broken
This charger is closed due to the Best Western being closed for the season.
"This charger is definitely in a convenient place for those of us who don't live in KC Proper.  It's outside a Hy-Vee with a dining area, which has helped me out on a few occasions when traveling from a colocation facility in NKC to Topeka around lunchtime.  Today, it was a handy stop a few minutes away from Zona Rosa, where I dropped my family off for a half hour while I charged.

My car only pulled 70kW, but if you're not in a huge hurry, that's not that big of a deal."
"This charger is excellent in terms of speed. There are 12 stalls and this is a 2021 V3 charger that maxed out to 250kW. Car charged at 1000 mi/hr! This location is good, not the best place to place it at. There is a Smithfield's and a Citgo. If you walk a little bit you can go to the McDonald's, Starbucks, and some other gas stations. Problem is, this charger is incredibly fast - so you won't be here for a long time. We were good to go in 20 minutes. I wish there were more options within closer range."
"This charger is in a creepy parking garage basement. It wasn't very clean. I guess that's to be expected from a parking garage. The parking garage does belong to a whole foods though, so you can shop while you're charging! That is the one nice thing about the charger."
"This charger is in a great location, however, the slowest supercharger I have been to."
"This charger is in the back left hand corner of the parking lot of West Plaza Country Mart, you cannot see it directly from the road. It is behind the bank and the garden center. This charger recently opened up in the last month and is a Level 3 Charger. Normally I would hit the Salina charger on the way down from Omaha to McPherson but feel like I will enjoy this stop more as it is faster and also has 12 different chargers. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is I did not see a bathroom in the grocery store and ran to the gas station on the other side of the lot. It is a small gas station with one bathroom that is decently kept. Just keep in mind is is a minimum $6.00 charge on your credit card or they will add a fee to run the card."
"This charger is in the Queens Center, a mall that requires to pay parking fees for accessing the tesla supercharger"
This charger is non functioning. Please do not attempt to use this charging station.
"This charger is not for public use and probably shouldn't be visible on maps. They let us charge, but only because we were basically out of charge, and then they made us massively overpay. Avoid this place if you can."
"This charger is pretty busy. I'm hoping Tesla can expand this a bit.

It's in great location though, with many little restaurants and shops. As long as you aren't hitting this in the middle of the night,  there are plenty of places to grab a bite to eat, or just get out and walk around.

Update
They have added 4 stalls since it first opened, but there is normally a wait during the day. Very busy location."
"This charger is right in the middle of everything anyone would need. Giant Eagle has liquor, bathrooms.  every major store chain is near by."
This charger is tucked in the back of a Fairfield Inn parking lot. Hotel had clean restrooms and a canteen if you need to buy snacks.
"This charger like all Tesla superchargers (most of the time) was working and in full functional order.  Not too crowded with less than half the Chargers being used.  There's a gas station, hotel and Bar and grill all sharing the same parking lot so while there's not plenty to do there are at least restrooms that are available 24 hours a day. The bar and grill has pretty good drinks and decent food and the gas station has a little mini mart with whatever road trip snacks you might need.
I would rate this supercharger a 7.5 out of 10"
"This charger location is great, right beside Tim Horton and the Tamarack mall is just a few more steps away."
This charger seemed quite a bit faster today than normal. It is always nice being able to step into a bathroom here as well.
This charger was convenient when I was visiting in NC. Very clean lot. Sheetz has decent food too.
This charger was not working 3/25. Thé restaurant is fantastic but I wouldn’t count on charging while there.
This charger was occupied by a non Tesla vehicle when we asked to charge our vehicle the owner was very rude and said that the Lambertville House told them to park there and that is was for guest only. Clearly it’s not a destination charger and should be removed from the list.
This chargers are not working.
"This charging location is ""fine"". Full often and not enough stalls for this location.

Often, it is too cold in this location for the charger cables to stay in place. The charging cables fall on the ground most of the time during the winter and get filled with snow, making them unusable."
"This charging location worked into our trip planning but there is not too much nearby. The charging was slow.

There's a small plaza across the street. We noshed at the Rainbow Blossom Natural Food Market on sliced cheese and ham. There's a bakery/coffeehouse and a liquor store, where we found a nice bourbon as a gift for our friend."
"This charging station is at a clean and well-stocked QuickChek. There are also free air stations and 75 cents car vacuums available. It's a convenient location, right off of the Garden State Parkway. You will see it as soon as coming off of the Parkway exit."
"This charging station is awesome. Super fast, great little grocery store, very nice neighborhood. Very much recommended."
"This charging station is in the Charleston place hotel roundabout, not a parking garage (which is next door). It was the only city charger that allowed non-guest charging."
"This charging station is not usually crowded and has tons of places to walk to in Southpark Meadows.  I usually walk to Target and browse around, but I’ve also walked to the Haiku Sushi place or even charged while at my European Wax Center appointment.  Very convenient!"
"This charging station is so amazing, I need to give it 5 stars! I never thought I would say that! Free wine tastings, the burgers smelled amazing, a toilet to use, and a really nice indoor area to rest in. Can't say enough good things!"
"This charging station is super convenient, is close to a real gas station and store, and a couple of restaurants. It's also very close to the highway, so you don't have to drive very far to get to it. And like all Tesla charging stations it's clean, efficient, and saves a lot of money over gasoline."
This charging station must be in high demand due to the excessive wear and tear. I arrived only to find both plugs laying in dirt and weeds. I’m not a fan of using dirty plugs as this could lead to grime build and charging issues over time. I went to the second charging station in the rear of the property which were properly maintained.
"This charging station, at the FSK Mall, is slower than the Sheetz charging station across the street. Both stations are Tesla stations. Both are easy to use and in well lighted areas. The properties are also very clean. Both stations are never full so there is no waiting to charge. This station takes about 30 to 40 minutes to charge 20%."
"This Clearwater, FL.  Tesla model X was all by them selves."
"This destination charger is a lifesaver!! We left Rock Springs with 90%, and although it showed that we'd have 19% at Jackson, it has dropped down to 15%, and I was getting worried that if we were going to be going uphill we might not make it. It took a little bit of searching to find this, I think I found it on Google maps looking for ev chargers. However because he has been having problems with his neighbor stealing power from him and a snowplow crashing into one of the chargers, he keeps the power knife switch locked and only one charger works currently. #3 See photo of his note of time restrictions."
This gas station has everything from gas to bathrooms to Chester's and Subway. Cigarettes are sold here along with prepared sandwiches and potato salads.
"This grassy knoll is directly behind the charging station, it goes the length of it plus much longer as it continues on all the way behind the Welcome Center building.
Covered in daisy's and brown eyed Susan's this time of year, perfect spot to let your poochies out, to run & play & hey - even meet other PUGS, I couldn't have planned for such a nice rest stop experience if I had to. 📲❤️👍👍🐾😀"
"This has to be the busiest charging station I have been to. It is poorly lit, there are okay food options here. No garbage cans unless you go to the jack in the box."
This hotel is great!.
"This is 10 stall supercharger in Whitestown, IN. Tesla call it Zionsville Supercharger.
Max capacity is 150 kW.
Located in parking lot of MEIJER.
There are places to eat nearby.
McAlister’s Deli is just few steps away.
Thai Select Flamme Burger Which Which Chen’s Wok are pretty close too.

Holiday Inn Hampton Inn are at walking distance.
You can shop at Meijer or get your hair cut while charging .Sport Clip is just at few footsteps."
"This is 3 chargers similar to Tesla home charging systems, a little faster than a home system. Located on level 2 of the Mt Rushmore parking garage. (48A, 210V, giving me +22 miles/hour)"
"This is a 150kw charger located at the Holiday Inn Express. I typically stop here on a weekly basis as this is a route I travel frequently for work.  Typically I do not have an issue with getting a charger and for the most part, dont have an issue with charging speed. Although there are 250kw Charger in Abilene, KS, I honestly prefer this stop due to the clean bathrooms and the hospitality from the Holiday Inn Express. I had a fairly long charge this time around and they offered a Wi-Fi access code so I could get some work done. There is a gas station about a 6-10 min walk away. Plenty of options for food and drinks until your next pit stop."
"This is a 250 supercharger in a parking lot of a grocery store that is like a Costco, Traders Joe’s and Whole Foods all rolled in to one!  Great selection and low prices.  It’s a great way to kill 30-40 minutes while you charge.  Wonderful liquor store too!"
This is a big Supercharger in a busy area but we were able to get 254kW even with 12 of the available stalls taken.
This is a bit safe when traveling at night time .
This is a brand new 250 Kw charger. Well located by a Circle K. Very safe. Anybody going North  South should choose this over the Supercharger in Binghamton.
This is a busy area to charge your EV. The good thing about this area you can go and eat right next to these chargers is a five guys burger place and other restaurants.
This is a busy charger and two of the stalls were out of order. In a nice shopping center next to whole foods.
"This is a busy charger. There are 2 areas to enter and so 2 lines form.  We waited about 20 minutes to plugin. People were moving in and out and it was all good.

It's strange that there is only 1 supercharger for all of New Orleans. They should add more"
"This is a clean and sparsely attended Supercharger and frankly I prefer the charging station at a dealership nearby which I used with my BMW i3. But upon purchasing a Tesla I found that the CCS1 adaptor did not yet work with my 2019 Model 3. It is supposed to be enabled soon and I have written Tesla without any luck thus far; The message says ""early 2023"" and as I write this it is ""early 2023"""
This is a fairly slow charging charging station.  They operate in 220 v ar 12 A. This means a full charge would take close to 30 hours. Still it is free
This is a fast super charger and great location. If you need somewhere to stay there is the Hilton Garden Inn or the Country yard. There is bathroom in the bowling place when open and you can grab something to eat. Or you can also go to the gas station. Oh and it has like 20 chargers !!!!
"This is a free use charger, which is great, but definitely targeted at patrons of the BNB. One stall only, often blocked by other cars during busy evenings. There is a nearby restaurant as part of the BNB, but hours can be a bit tricky in my experience so Ive called ahead to check a few times. Not really sure if bathrooms are available here, if they are it's not broadcasted with signage. Thrilled they have a charger, and we've visited a few times because of this, but it is never my preferred goto location for my infrequent topup needs"
"This is a gem of a Supercharger with 12x fast charging stalls ( v3 / 250kw) and hardly any traffic. You won't be competing for spots or waiting for long, you just pull in, plug in, and shop at Stuckey's for a bit. It's also got the best view of any Supercharger I stopped at off I-40, which makes it a fabulous day-time stop.  At night, Stuckey's is all there is so it gets lonely fast. The store closes after 9 PM, so you lose access to the toilets and the Dairy Queen inside (if it's late and you can make it to Hickory or Asheville, I suggest you go there).

Speaking of toilets, that's my only real CON about this place. The toilets were terrible the last time I stopped here. Even if they were to be freshly serviced, the bathroom itself feels like it'll never be that be clean (or dry). On the other hand, it looks like there are showers available if you ask. I've definitely stopped at more welcoming Stuckey's though.  PROs? Cheap candy, and Stealth Bombers to keep you occupied (if you're not driving)."
"This is a gen2 supercharger which slows down when neighboring stalls are in use. It was crowded when we arrived and max speed we got was 56kw on a brand new model Y, what should have been a 5 minute wait became 20!  terrible!"
"This is a good location. The only problem you have 2 stall Telsa that's been sitting on the charger for 3 days waiting for Tow. Inconvenience when others could be using the stall. Other than that this location is safe, cameras on Target, near plenty of restaurants and Planet fitness"
"This is a good location. There is food available and it's close to the freeway. There's a Bob's burgers, and a brewery with food all in the same parking lot. There's also two hotels if you are looking for a place to stay. The next parking lot over has a Target and a planet fitness where you can do your shopping and get a quick workout and if needed, assuming you have a membership. The biggest issue I would say is it is a little in need of clean up. I have seen some supercharger locations that have a garbage can and even a station for cleaning your windshield, I don't know whose job it is to actually do garbage, cleanup and maintenance around the area. This stop definitely needs a little attention even though it is fairly new. Other than that it is a good place to charge up on your way heading east or west in Washington on Highway 82."
"This is a great charger... but I hate paying to charge in a parking deck, so they will only get 3 stars from me."
This is a great charging spot
This is a great charging stop just off the 101. It is in the parking lot for an outlet and in and out. There are several EVGo and Chargepoint chargers and maybe 12 tesla chargers with 4 maybe 5 tesla chargers that are juxt opposed to allow for pull in hook up. The bathroom in the outlets are eat off the floor clean. They are located in the far northeast corner of the outlet center. In and out would be to the south of the chargers.
"This is a great little stop. Nothing but the travel center around, but workman's was great. We got lunch, which was reasonably priced and tasty. Get the boudin balls and potato cakes. The staff was friendly, and everything was clean. Only took off one star for to a lack of options even thought I didn't really need them."
"This is a great location due to the adjacent Meijer store as well as an Aldi, Asian Buffet, McDonald's, Golden Corral and many other businesses nearby.  Starbucks is at the Lakes Mall perimeter, so that's a bit of a hike.  Biggby Coffee is across Harvey Street, so that's not an easy crossing.
The chargers are at the extreme southern end of the Meijer parking lot and therefore unlikely to be ICEd (parked up with internal combustion engine cars)."
"This is a great location for charges with lots of amenities nearby. However, be aware, the superchargers are on the first floor of the parking structure and there are destination chargers spread out on the other levels. This was confusing my first time there."
This is a great location with plenty of open stalls they will never probably be a lot of Teslas here unless they have a Tesla meet up here. There is a mall located within the area and plenty of other hotels and food areas. At night there may not be much open around everything usually closes around 9 to 10 o’clock. The area is a safe area! But I probably would not charge alone at night.  They have a Tesla trashcan so you can throw away all the stuff in your car. I’m hoping soon that tesla charging station will be just like gas stations with a convenient store in bathrooms.
"This is a great location, restaurants and coffee shop at walking distance. I would like to see a trash can in the area.
Update 8/19/21: High technology to show one stall is not working. 6 more stalls opening soon.
Elon: what about a small light to show if the stalls work?
Update 11/21: rain and you will put your feet in 5"" of water with 300 volt on your hand😱
Update 7/2022, this facility hs been disable since January 2022."
This is a great place to charge a Tesla. It charges at 150kw and is typically not very busy. There is a sonic in a Zaxby's nearby as well as a Publix. Grocery store. Very convenient location. Clean and safe. Would highly recommend.
"This is a great place to do a longer time charge! They have added a nice map of the little downtown area with places to shop, walk and rest. Stopped at Perla Baking Co. for coffee and took a walk near the lake."
"This is a great place to stop and charge. The location in whitewood is perfect for dividing up Brandon & Regina, and this charger is just off the highway and easy to get to also.

Always reliable, and nearby a nice and clean coop with washrooms and lots of food/snack options too. Having the CCS/CHAdeMO Coop chargers on the other end of the parking lot is just a bonus for other EV drivers too.

This location is also one of the only highway 1 superchargers that also has a garbage can and squeegee available which is super convenient to have right there. Glad this location exists, and always have been able to draw the full 250 kW from these stations."
This is a great place to top off your Tesla because there are several places nearby to eat or shop.
This is a great SC location with tons to do. Shopping and food. Schedule your trip to spend a long stop here. Note that there are a few long lights to get in and out. Tons of traffic here the week before Christmas. Doh!
This is a great spot and the chargers are in good shape. There is a good Sobey's just across the way if you're hungry and have 30 minutes on your hands.
This is a great spot to charge when coming through the area!  There’s 20 chargers here and normally only 3 or 4 are being used.  It’s right off 295 and there are many places to spend some time while your Tesla charges.
"This is a great spot to charge your Tesla.  There is 2 hour free parking with validation, 15 superchargers, and many places to shop and eat in the area.  My toddler and I shop at Whole Foods all the time and our car gets a big shot of juice while we shop.  BTW, Whole Foods validates parking, too."
"This is a great stop. 24h restrooms, WiFi, great view, visitor center, trashcans, nearby shade and picnic tables, childrens playground and field."
"This is a great supercharger location. Close to the strip, easy to access with a pin available inside your car or by pressing the ""call"" button at the gate. You also get the added advantages of being near two hotel entrances (the Flamingo and Hilton Grande Vacation), the monorail and getting to watch people take videos and photos of their car for the likes."
"This is a great supercharger location. Plenty of charging stalls, area is clean, and there is a lot of parking since it’s a Wawa gas station/store."
"This is a great supercharger with a pretty big rest station next to it. There's half decent food, very clean bathrooms, and something to look at while you wait for the car to recharge. It's just off the highway, but it's far enough away that you don't have to listen to the highway constantly. At least, I didn't notice it."
"This is a great supercharger! It's kind of hidden behind a fence, so look for the big Certified Scales sign to find your way. There's a shopping area a short walk away with a little bakery, an ice cream shop, a knick-knack store, and a full restaurant. I hit a charging rate of 145kW on my model 3."
This is a great supercharging station. Charge really fast right next to sheets so it’s very convenient to get some food and use the restroom while the car is charging. There are a total of 7 stalls. There were only a few cars when I arrived.
This is a great Tesla charging location. It is conveniently located close to a few stores. Go to Dolly's Diner for a great experience.
"This is a Hotel Charger, dont come here"
"This is a little ways away from the interstate, there aren't any food options around unless you go to the gas station or casino. The chargers are well spaced out and generally always available as I have used them a few times and it is not as busy as others."
This is a much needed station cuz there’s nothing else for miles. But it really needs to be upgraded to faster speed. My stops here are always the longest on my trip.
This is a new and exciting experience for me. The process is simple not too lengthy and accessible
"This is a nice location, plenty of chargers. bathrooms are very clean and there’s plenty of options of something to eat such as Mitches. Texas style barbecue, and Wendy’s. If you have a dog or any kind of pet, they have a small pet area for you to let them go to the bathroom and run around as well as a small playground for kids"
This is a nice location. The bathrooms are in the hotel but still publicly available. Easy for us and kids.
This is a nice place to charge. There are healthy and tasty restaurants right next door. There is a Walmart and a Trader Joes a short walk away.
"This is a nice super charger station for several reasons: 1. It is kept clean, I assume by Meijer, which is just across the parking lot. 2. The charging station is a square, six stations in one side, six on the other. 3. The charging station is in its own little nook, so there is no through traffic. 4. Mike's Carwash is right across the way. For anyone passing through town, yes you can trust Mike's with your car. They are a very professional regional chain. 5. Meijer has put a trash can at the charging station. 6. Safe location due to high traffic."
"This is a nice, clean, and well situated charger at the Centennial Hotel. It has a nice, high rate of charge; my 100D was able to charge at 72 amps. Go inside and grab a drink or a nice meal at the Granite restaurant, you’ll be glad you did."
"This is a niche of a niche. What a joke, you'd have to go 143 miles to buy the car required to use this. As of May 2022 there were 2230 registered EVs in Vermont, which is 0.37% of the vehicles registered in Vermont. And how many of those are NOT Tesla and therefore can't use this charging station?"
"This is a popular charger.  The last 2 times used, there was a line to wait for a spot"
"This is a pretty good supercharger right next to the highway. Fast food, restrooms. It's on the back side/drive thru area so at night it feels lonely but otherwise great! I wish there were more near Vail though."
This is a pretty good Tesla charging spot. Only need is some breakfast/coffee place for the early morning charge. Other than that there’s a lot to explore and knock some things off your to do list. There are a ton of stations which is great. We used this location a number of time during our Bay Area trip as it’s the last place to charge before heading to the Coast.
This is a private place and if you are not staying there you can not charge your vehicle. It has a security gate with guard. Do not waste your time going there unless you are staying there. Wish I would have known that sooner.
"This is a really new supercharger and what a great experience! This location has a family run burger joint AND winery! Stop by here to get one of the best burgers I've eaten in a while (We got the cowboy burger and jalapeno burger), as well as great milkshakes!

Public washroom is also provided here. The sitting area is spacious and the owner is so friendly! We ended up getting some wine to bring back home to Canada as well. Highly recommend this stop just for the burger to be completely honest :)"
This is a Royal Farms gas station with a half dozen Tesla chargers on site. I drive a Honda so I can't rate the electric chargers.
"This is a slow charge Tesla station. 8kW, 242V. It's attached to deck railing. 4 stars because it's free!"
"This is a slower charger than a super charger (model 3 50% charge is 5 hours) and requires you valet your car. But it's closer to good shops and restaurants so if you are doing a quick pit stop, not a bad place. Plus a supercharger is nearby. If they allowed it for non valet vehicles this would  be a 5 star easily."
"This is a small town, and there isnt much around. But the chargers are in a Hannaford & Walmart shared parking lot."
"This is a solid Tesla Charger, but the kW got as low as 56 on the charger all the way on the right in front of Brew Burgers handicap spots. (We also move spots to see if it would increase the kilowatts which it did not.) There was only two other cars charging. The Brew Burgers is open from 11:00 AM to 10:00 PM everyday! Plus there is a shell gas station and if you walk about five minutes, there’s a McDonald’s, Car Wash and Pings (Chinese & Sushi) less than a mile.

Update: We got down to 47 kW with us being the only car on the charger at 60% battery."
"This is a standard 250 kw Tesla Supercharger, little-used as it is new and in the back of the Sheetz gas station so an empty charging slot is easily found. One pull-in stall on the end."
This is a Super Charger 150 only
"This is a tight parking lot, but I like it because it is very close to the store. Plus the store has their bathroom right at the entryway. Food options are limited though. There is a sit-down restaurant across the parking lot, which normally takes longer than you would spend during a charging stop."
This is a V3 Supercharger. The bathrooms are right near the entrance of the Hannafords. There are no fast food restaurants just the supermarket.
"This is a V3, the charging speed is suburb. The problem is that the bathrooms are on the other side of the mall at the supermarket and their are no fast food options or a Duncan Donut."
"This is a very convenient location, so that gets a 5-star review. But, lately, it is only charging at 34kW. I have tried 3 different chargers at this location and all have the same paltry charging rate. Not sure what is up. Anyone else having this issue?  (Posted Oct 16, 2022)"
This is a very convenient Supercharger location. It’s in the WaWa parking lot and next door is a BBQ place and a chicken place within walking distance. The only downside is it is very crowded with a limited number of chargers. I have been there 3 times and never had to wait though.
"This is a very good location with a nice convenience store nearby. But in early March of 2023 they are doing work on it and have units tagged out as unsafe. This is not the case. My model 3 did not alert me that these were tagged out. Another driver was already there and told me their car was charging despite the unsafe warning. Tesla needs to address this as the tags were placed on February 27th, 2023 more than one week ago. Get this cleaned up."
"This is a very nice place to charge before going and leaving Yosemite.  6 super chargers.  Not busy.  A few bars, shops, and restaurants near by."
"This is a weird location. There isn’t much around but it’s a near-essential place to have a charger located at least. The amenities nearby or in walking distance are sparse, but exist at least. This is an older v2 station so it isn’t fast and requires other drivers to be courteous and leave every second stall unused.

There also seems to be a long standing issue with water pooling in front of and around the chargers on the pavement- there was a lake when I visited.

In the end, the charger works, it’s in a fine enough spot, and there’s at least a business or two within walking distance. It’s just in the bottom tier of supercharger locations and it leaves nearby Lethbridge with no charger at all requiring drivers to come out here. Oh well."
This is a well-executed installation with both Tesla and J-1772 EVSE charging stations.  Please leave a visible phone number on your car in case others would like to share the power.
This is actually a V3 Supercharger. Google lists it as 72 kW and hopefully they process my edit suggestion soon. Briefly reached 229 kW (955 mi/hr). Great location.
"This is amazing! 250kw charger in the heart of Pigeon Forge.. wonderful. One time while charging here we went to the “Downtown Flavortown” arcade/restaurant and had a blast while we recharged. This location is a 10m walk to Publix supermarket .. so I dropped my wife off there and charged for 30 min while she shopped, then picked her up. Very fast charger at a convenient location."
"This is amazing! As a guest traveling from Nashville, Tennessee, I did not consider that I would not have enough charge to make it to the next super charger on the way home. I am so grateful for this charging station. I can’t even put it into words."
"This is among the most scenic superchargers I've ever stopped at. In addition, there's a little sandwich shop right next to it with a bunch of convenient store items as well as fresh food made to order. The two women that own the store were incredibly friendly and accommodating."
This is an awesome addition to the supercharger network. Brand new chargers and there are 12.  I knocked a star because the super chargers are often blocked by work trucks or other commercial type work vehicles since they’re located in the HEB Plus fuel station just in front of the line of fuel pumps.
"This is an awesome location, but caught in a catch-22 here. On one hand having this location a couple blocks off main street and in a residential area keeps ICE vehicles from blocking the chargers. It's a necessity for such a high traffic location like this and one where Tesla's flow in and out continually. On the other, I'd love for the charger to be closer to the water and the sights of Osoyoos so I can walk around and see everything while topping up. There's no right answer, and I absolutely can't complain about where this charger is.

The views here are incredible as expected, and it's yet another location that I wish I could spend more time in. Osoyoos is a beautiful town and worth coming here for the charge and staying longer.

The reliability of this location doesn't seem that high unfortunately and some stalls seemed to be down on occasion."
"This is an closed Texaco (with a fallen over sign) and DQ store (perhaps due to a recent storm? Not clear) Since it’s not open, No restrooms. Also has advertised a dog park.  All we saw were some abandoned steel bowls behind a Tesla charger, not enclosedl. Plus is 8 Tesla chargers are up and running. The closest thing is a Citgo across the street which the owner isn’t so keen on having a bunch of non customers using their restroom. There is Love’s truck stop on the other side of the overpass (Ie not walkable) that has a restroom, McDonalds, Subway and a convenience store. Would not recommend unless this is a quick charge and you don’t need the restroom or food. Otherwise would either plan to go to Florence to charge if you are on 95. Or plan to make two stops and additional time."
This is an extremely convenient location right in the mall parking lot. There are several restaurants right next to it. There is also a movie theater inside the mall in case you need to charge a little longer you can just catch a movie. I have charged here many times and I have never Had to wait to get a charging spot.
This is an ideal location for a supercharger. It doesn't get any better.  Buc-ees has anything and everything you need. We had lunch and shopped around for a bit. I had to unplug and move the car since it finished charging before we were done exploring Buc-ees.  I hope to see more superchargers at locations like this in the future!
"This is an odd little supercharger station tucked away in a corner next to a Walmart. Arrived at night, the only parking lot light near the chargers was not working so it was much darker than it looked in the photograph, it all felt a little sketchy. Charging stations were clearly marked and well maintained. Would choose another location if you're charging at night."
"This is an older gen 2 supercharger which slow down when neighboring stalls are in use. When we arrived it was crowded and max speeds were 60kw, about a fourth of what the car is capable of, turning a 5 minute stop into a 20 minute one. This area of texas desperately needs upgraded superchargers."
"This is an older V2 150kW Tesla Supercharger. We pulled in and 4 out of the 6 stalls were occupied. Hard to find in the back of the hotel. Remember, 1A and 1B, 2A and 2B, 3A and 3B each share 150kW capacity.  So if it is full, it’s going to be SLOW. 3 of the 4 cars there had no occupants in them. 🤷🏼‍♂️ This location needs updated to the V3 250kW (there is no sharing and it makes a big difference)."
"This is an unusual supercharger design. It's not just one row of stalls behind the cars, there are stalls seeming to go every which way. It accommodates a lot of different kinds of pull-in styles, which may make it more beneficial for certain situations."
"This is another Supercharger sharing space with Sheetz. Always well lit and easy to find.

This Sheetz appears to have a drive-thru along with indoor/outdoor eating areas. A few cars ICEd some stalls but until the M3 is really out in numbers it doesn’t bother me right now.

There’s only 1 pull in and the rest are reverse in stalls."
This is another uncrowded supercharger - located in the Hampton Inn parking lot.  Bathrooms in the Hampton Inn.  There aren’t really any good places to get a snack or drink however.
This is at Soaring Eagle in the valet section.  Also some on the 2nd floor at the end of the diamond parking section. Be sure you bring your J-xxx adapter.
This is behind the resident garage door so is not open to the public.
This is broken. Don't bother. I should've taken a picture but didn't have my phone with me. The charger head was missing some of the pins. This was mid August 2020
"This is definitely a great addition at Katy, ample amount of chargers and all level 3, 250kw, so no power sharing! This is a great option to power up before heading out of Houston."
This is definitely one of the best places to charge your Tesla. Its 250 KWh and there’s a HUGE gas station with everything you need next to it.
this is extremely convenient
This is Great News! I just hope it will be open to all EVs
This is in a small restaurant parking lot which allows the customers to park in our Tesla charging spots. I pull up and half of the chargers are taken by gas guzzling vehicles.
"This is in the parking garage of Hard Rock Casino. We were there for less than 60 mins so didn’t have to pay anything for access however, the garage was full of trash all around."
This is in the parking lot of the Holiday Inn. 8 stalls with 120kW max. Bojangles beside it and a Pizza Hut across the street. Nice place
This is my favorite supercharge location.
This is my favorite supercharger location in Orlando! Easy to get to and although relatively busy I’ve never had to wait for a charger. Wawa is one of their better ones as well and also within walking distance of a lot of shopping and restaurants.
"This is my favorite supercharger spot that I've been too. Can't beat a Bucees...  The charging was fast and not many stalls in use.

The only mild complaint I could mention is that it's a longish walk back and forth from the store without much in the way of pedestrian markings, walkways or anything. Just keep looking around and stay safe while you get a lovely kolache and brisket sammie!"
"This is my favorite Tesla charging station so far! Cross the road to the Baymont hotel, walk to the back, and there are stairs down to the concrete path around Blue Lake. It takes about 20 minutes to walk all the way around the lake, and by then you should be most of the way charged. Great stop!"
"This is my favorite Tesla supercharger stop! The convenience store has a Moe's Southwest grill, it has a wonderful hot bar that has the best fried chicken!  the bathrooms are spotless too!! so if you're up and down I75 make sure you plan your stop here"
This is my favorite type of supercharger! 75 yards off the highway. I only wish they could all be that convenient. Nice little station as well. Friendly staff.
"This is my second time charging my car at this station. The reason that I gave 3 is that the charging rate drop so fast comparing to other stations. The location is great, in the parking lot of Holiday Inn. I am taking my husky for a road trip, can’t stay at this hotel as they don’t take pets. If you stay at this hotel and have no pets, this station is perfect."
"This is not a 250kw charger. I tried multiple spots with my Model y, and I could barely get 133kw."
"This is not a charger open to the public. I went here because there are NO chargers in Sebring, this charger is only for hotel guests and I had to explain that if I didn’t charger I would be stranded. Closest charger to Sebring is Arcadia (depending on where you’re going)"
This is not a gas station!
"This is not a gas station. It should not come up as a search result in google maps when I search ""gas station""."
This is not a safe area. I would never let my wife charge her Tesla/EV at night here. During the day it might be okay. This part of Oakland is the straight up hood.   Please Tesla —- find a new location closer to the 580 freeway. Anything along the 880 freeway is not a safe place.
"This is not a super charger...a real bummer considering we were planning on spending an hour here, not 10. No super chargers in Pullman? Seems so strange."
This is not a Tesla charging station. It’s a dark lot in the middle of nowhere. Accross the street there is a WAWA gas station. I thought would be the correct location and there is no Tesla station.
This is not a Tesla destination charger.
"This is not located in a good spot. It's a shared rest area and walled off for north vs south bound traffic. Tesla instructed us to U-turn off an exit to enter, and had to double back in the wrong direction to turn around again and added 49 mins to our journey. Lost 10% just to charge rediculous!!"
This is not open yet.  Hoping soon.  Gave it 5 stars in anticipation of opening.
"This is ok. 10pm, just me. Better to drive the car to the food max for safety."
This is older gen Tesla supercharger with only 6 stalls and up to150KW. Very busy site so you will most likely share at lower KW during peak hours - This is the first Tesla supercharger I've ever had to wait to charge. If you're travelling long distance on I-10 would recommend using Live Oak to Marianna & vice versa if you can make that work - we did with no issues and Marianna is 250KW. This site either needs to be upgraded or Tesla should add another Tallahassee site - just too busy an area with Tesla drivers to support.
"This is one of my favorite charger locations. I rarely have to wait and nearly all the chargers work as expected each time. It is clean, well-lit and patrolled by security."
This is one of my favorite superchargers on my 400 mile habit trail from NH to MD. We have never had to wait for a charger. It is near the WaWa gas pumps.
"This is one of my favorite superchargers. There are always chargers available, there are plenty of stores and restaurants and you can walk around for exercise in a lighted parking lot with sidewalks."
This is one of my favorite wine bars! Great ambiance and the bartenders are always the best. If your lucky you’ll get a piano player.
"This is one of the best charging stations I've been to. Easy access from the highway and its close to many restaurants. It's located behind the Dunkin Donuts, so it's perfect if you want to grab a coffee and quick bite to eat. The thing that wowed me was that the Dunkin Donuts has a legit conference room inside. It was bizarre to see but it was perfect for the hour-long call I needed to take. As long as it's not reserved and nobody is using it, the staff will let you use it for work. This location is also perfect for charging up and skipping charging at Chattanooga if you're on your way to Atlanta. The Chattanooga Supercharger is at the airport and bit out of the way."
"This is one of the best located chargers I've used. Right next to a convenience shop, and paired with window washing squeegees!"
"This is one of the best Supercharger locations there's plenty of accommodations nearby Meier's, Chipotle, IHOP, Five Guys. When you enter the area there's a Starbucks and up the street is a Macy's."
"This is one of the best Superchargers I've been to.
1. It's right off the interstate
2. It's easy to get to (not in a private or paid lot)
3. There's a great coffee shop across the street with food and bathrooms
4. Fast charging speeds"
This is one of the better charging stations we stoped at along our trip.  The restrooms are by Rue21.  A few places to shop at.
"This is one of the better charging stations. Seems to be cheaper sometimes n less crowded, maybe? They’re all pretty crowded. But there’s a Target right there, walking distance, so you can shop n charge if you want. This is in a residential apt complex with a toddler day care in the middle of it all, just FYI. There are also other chargers with different plug-ins, I’m not sure what kind, I haven’t checked it out."
"This is one of the better superchargers in Kansas.

Playground for the kids.
Dog run for our furry friends.
Coffee and food for the rest of us.

It looks like they are building more stuff too."
This is one of the few area Chargers that actually has some shopping in walking distance however there are only eight Chargers and two to three of them are completely broken and have been for months.  Please fix them as the place is always crowded and you usually have to wait
This is one of the smaller groups in town with 4 chargers. Never had an issue being able to charge besides an inconsiderate FedEx and Arrow Waste drivers. It is at the gas station and it is very busy with cars entering and exiting the gas station. There is a Starbucks in the gas station and the gas station offers many amenities.  There is also a McDonald's with in waking distance. There is a trail system that can be utilized also while you are waiting.
This is right in front of the H‑E‑B gas station a clear throwing the towel in the face of gas cars. The distance so good that when people are filling their gas they can wait and see the Tesla charger at one hand distance. The big H‑E‑B store is walking distance and good for grocery shopping while the charging occurs. The area is nice and clean. Only 1 charger was down and tied up with Jute rope but other chargers were all working. Gave 4 stars due to one charger not maintained properly.
"This is Sheetz. The only. Local place with e85 fuel and tesla  chargers.
See photos? Car on wrecker ? No juice. Dont they really feel stupid now?"
This is such a nice Supercharging station. Parker’s Store and area are clean and personnel are personal and helpful. Highly recommend it. Also food is good.  Easy access from I95 even though you have to exit off onto I16.
"This is supposed to be a 250 charger but we’ve never seen the charging speed of other such chargers. The closest toilets we could find are in the Family Dollar store. The Food Giant has them hidden, probably to prevent Tesla owners from coming inside. I would also use some caution after dark in the area nearby.  There is a McDonalds a short walk away but I’d stop there first then charge."
"This is the best Supercharger station in Kansas.  The location is great with plenty of amenities nearby.  The Oasis Travel center has all of the standard convenience store stuff plus a Qdoba, Starbucks, and Quiznos inside.  Plenty of inside seating is available too.  There are 10 Supercharger stalls located in the back."
"This is the centrally located and convinent location of the Tesla supercharger.
But poorly managed and needs to long time waiting for charging because other cars were parked in charging stations & place with combustion engines cars.
There’s a room for improvement as a Tesla supercharger station.
Everything is not money but service also parts of business.
Need to be understood
Thank you"
"This is the charger closest to my house so I come here quite often. The location is great but here's the reason I'm not giving it a 5. A few months ago there was a business who always had 4 and 5 cars charging and they would leave the Tesla and get in another car, Taki g up spaces.  Now Nationwide General Contracting is here every time I come! They park the Tesla, put out business cards and leave! How do the businesses get away with leaving a Tesla at a charging station? What about idle fees? Frustrating because this is a very busy charging station any way!"
"This is the coolest hugest Supercharger location I've ever been to.

It's like a super Walmart it's got everything.....Public facilities, great food and groceries, gas and ofcourse the Super charger right of interstate 75N to Chattanooga."
This is the current situation in most of the Tesla supercharger. Tesla is selling more cars but not making enough supercharger and this is resulting is extended wait time. People who will drive by this long line will rethink if it’s worth getting a car that you have to wait in a long line just to get it charged. Tesla please do something this entire Parkin lot is empty so I don’t understand what is taking you guys so long to install some more. Not fair to the Tesla owners do something ASAP
This is the first 250 kW charger in the state.
This is the first one for morehead kentucky
"This is the kind of place you hope to find when you pull in to feed your Tesla. The Falls Church Supercharger has fast 250kw stalls and active strip mall with lots of things to grab your attention. Looking for something to eat yourself? There's the delicious Tara Thai, Starbucks, Jason's deli , Bing&Bao (a chinese Bao restaurant!), Noodles & Company and Whole Foods. Seriously, by the time you're done picking out road snacks at Whole Foods your Tesla is ready to tear up some more road. Also, as a bonus, there's plenty of room here to pull into the charger spots!"
"This is the last supercharger on the way south to Corpus Christi, and Corpus (as of June 2022) doesn't have a supercharger station.  So there the Teslas are forced to plead with hotels for trickle charging, in order to make it back to this location on the return north.  The host convenience store is clean and well stocked but the women's w.c. had a queue of a dozen."
this is the oldest charger in the area and it shows. they need maintenance. it’s often busy so expect a wait at times. it’s definitely not the ‘typical’ supercharger experience nor locale.
"This is the only stop for a while, expect traffic, though there are slow times. With about 25 cars in queue it took about 2 hours before charging. If all bays are used, max charging speed is about 110KW. A couple small shops near by, and if during the day, see if you can go into the museum.

Edit: Drove back through after the week and only 1  stall being used. It will depends on the day you are traveling"
"This is the ONLY Supercharger in the 50 mile radius. Tesla needs to ADD 2-3 MORE SUPERCHARGERS DOWNSLOPES, is in Reedsville, Milroy or Lewistown areas"
"This is the only supercharger on South Padre Island. The next closest is about 25 miles away in Brownsville. It is located at the Beach Resort at South Padre Island. As far as amenities, there's a Taco Palenque fast food restaurant inside the resort, as well as a bar and grill located just down the walkway at the beach. Oh yeah, plus you can access the beach from here for free.

There's only 2 working superchargers at this location, but they're usually available and there's even 4 level 2 free Tesla chargers located in the same parking lot."
"This is the only supercharger where operator has trash cans and windshield washer fluid available. It is right behind convenience store off the interstate. Pleasant stuff, clean store as well. Well done Kum and Go"
"This is the only Tesla charging available in hundred miles radius and it didn't work for me during the Labor Day weekend (2020). I left supercharger at Burlington, WA with full charge (280 miles worth), Winthrop is 140 miles one-way, so it was a tight roundtrip with no room for error; so I visited this destination charger hoping to add 30 miles for safety. Neither of the 2 Tesla chargers worked (the charging port glowed red, and the panel said 'charging equipment fault'). The faculty at the lodge tried to reset the chargers a couple of times, but that didn't change anything.

First, the destination chargers are at the top of a mountain that's 12 miles from Winthrop, but takes 25 miles worth of battery to reach from Winthrop -- so, when you go there and the charger doesn't work, you've now wasted 25-30 miles of battery to make that trip up the hill and in vain. No one at the lodge can tell you either upfront if the chargers work or otherwise -- they won't know.

There's a third non-Tesla charger; but beware it's a 30A charger, which will charge about 17miles per hour at best.

I suggest - don't bother with this charging option unless you have a 10kWh buffer to gamble with. Instead, your best bets are some of the camping grounds (KOA for example) that lets you use 50A plugs for 5-6 hours in RV camping slots for $20 or so (of course you'd need your charging cable & adapters). In fact, the entire SR-20 stretch is a terrible idea with a Tesla right now -- until Tesla installs a supercharger in Winthrop. Hope they do soon -- it's one of the popular routes for camping/vacationing."
"This is the quickest available Supercharger in the general vicinity (within 60 square miles). As of March 8th, 2023, all chargers are fully operational. There is a shopping cart collection point right next to the station for easy shopping after visiting the associated Meijer store. Trash & recycling receptacles are available nearby, as well. Nothing negative to note."
"This is the second Supercharger that we have visited that is located at the back of a Smithfield’s Chicken N’ Bar-B-Q. The chargers are fast, the area clean, and the food is great."
"This is the supercharger from hell. I’d give it -5 stars if possible. It’s located at Buc-ee’s, which was a madhouse. If coming from westbound I-20 it is decently easy to get into from the off-ramp. From eastbound I-20 however you sit in a tremendous traffic jam that takes 10-15 minutes to get through. And then you have to get to the opposite side of Buc-ee’s to charge. Getting out only takes 10-12 minutes. Inside they have a small mall but again, you’ll stand in line a long time to pay. On our way out we talked to a state trooper. I asked if this was abnormal. Naw, he said, it’s like this all the time. If you have to stop here then I suppose you do. But if you can plan your trip to not require a stop here your life will be so much better."
This is the worst charging station I have been to. We waited 1.5 hours to charge for 25 mins. Most of the stalls were taken up by cars done charging already and just leaving car unattended. I found one spot where the car wasn't even plugged in and security did end up giving it a citation. They are trying to manage the situation but overall bad experience
This is the worst super charger I have been to.  Located in a sketchy alley with many people experiencing homelessness. Wouldn’t want to be here at night. Price is higher than the other charger in town. Good options are bad and no bathrooms. Don’t go here.
"This is very close to highway 1 near Monterey Bay. You don’t feel bored while charging because it is near to mall. Its very close to macys, there are lot of close by restaurants most of the time these stalls are busy . We visited this station during the 17 mile drive. The super charging is super. It was able to charge nearly 200 miles per hour.i am so impressed with the charging."
This is where the New Service Center is for the Spokane area.
This is why we love Tesla The supercharger network just works it’s a different way to travel you get a break can stretch out and usually find a restroom or a great restaurant like all you can eat KKoki Korean barbecue. It was awesome!
This is your typical supercharger at a truck stop with truck stop food. There's not much to do while you charge. I'm giving a 4th star since there are some food options a short drive down the street.
"This isn't a super charger, it charges super slow, like a 1 mile every 3 mins. This isn't a place to go to if you have low charge, just a place to add charge while eating"
"This level-2 Tesla destination charger is right near the entrance to the Meridian Restaurant and Bar.  There doesn't appear to be any cost for using it.  Beware though ... there are only two spots here.  When we were at Pacific City for three nights, one Model S Tesla was parked in one spot, charging for at least two days and nights.  So you might not find a spot to charge here if there are inconsiderate drivers using the facility.

One other note: apparently they have adapters you can use to charge non-Tesla cars, available in the office, but I didn't have need for that, so I didn't go ask for one."
"This location does not have a charging station. Per attendant at this location, “it no work.” It hasn’t worked for a while and estimates this is a permanent closure. I suggest for this charging station be removed. Unnecessary waste of time driving to this location only to be told it doesn’t work"
"This location has 6 superchargers, available 24 hours a day, up to 250 kW charging.  Located in Westfield Crossing and close to several services such as Dollarama, Sobeys and restaurants such as  Burger King and Boston Pizza.  Nice seeing the EV charging options expand across Western Canada."
"This location has 8 superchargers, available 24 hours a day, up to 250 kW charging.  Located in Polo Park Mall parking lot and close to several services such as Hudsons Bay and plenty of eateries with the indoor mall.  Also lots of big box development in the surrounding area for things to do while waiting for charge."
This location has a pull in stall so you can charge with a trailer on the vehicle.
"This location is adjacent to Woodman's super grocery store, at the Orchard Road exit on the north side of the I-88 Tollway; there are a number of hotels/motels less than a mile down south of I-88 on Orchard Road.
Another poster incorrectly identified this location as adjacent to ""HWY 80"" but it's actually at the Orchard Road exit off Interstate 88. Interstate 80 is quite a distance away from here."
This location is always full during the week with people wearing orange vests who don't park every other spot to preserve charging speeds
"This location is conveniently located and has plenty of chargers, but it gets busy on peak evening hours. Not very sure why my avg charging speed never passes 65kWh…"
"This location is horrible, it always charges at 32kW and there's usually a wait, theres only 4 chargers now as they are building eversource car charging spots. Slowest charging spot.
They do have a store, dunkin and subway sandwiches."
"This location is much better to charge up than having to navigate through construction around the Waco supercharger. Seems a couple of the stalls weren't working properly seeing as other drivers moved to other stalls after a few minutes.

** UPDATE 9/11/2022 **
Now that it seems the Waco construction is done(?), we still prefer this charger as the amenities for the Waco charger are limited to the Collins Street bakery which doesn't open until noon on Sundays and closes at 6pm everyday. But the Italy station has clean bathrooms (gas station) and other restaurants close by, both on the and same side and other side of the freeway."
"This location is new (Jan 2020) with 12 superchargers. It's in a clean, bright shopping center just off 195 & 495.

Stores: Lowe's, Target, TJ Maxx, Michael's, Staples, Petco, DSW Shoes, Homegoods, Old Navy, LL Bean, The Black Dog outlet, Torrid, Gamestop, GNC, Cape Kids, Bath & Body Works, USA Fitness for Women, Famous Footwear, LOFT, Dressbarn, The Paper Store, California Nails & Spa, Sally Beauty Supply, Yankee Candle, T-Mobile, Sprint, AT&T, & Verizon.

Food: Qdoba, Cupcake Charlie's, Gourmet Garden, Casa Cancun, Cosi, Longhorn Steakhouse, & Red Robin.

Directly across from the chargers is a South Coast Urgent Care Center."
This location is on the side of the Best Western in the back.  40 Amp charging rate.  Go inside to have them turned on. Small fee if not a guest.
This location is perfect for a long charge.  There are a couple fast food options nearby but there are also sit down chains you could eat at if you have a long charging session.  There's a mall here too if that is of interest.
This location is super convenient to the highway. It also has a lot of options if you need food or something else to do while charging. There is a grocery store in the same parking lot as well as several quick food options and even a nail salon.
"This location is the Sheraton New Orleans Hotel. This is not a public charging stations. The Tesla designated chargers are for guess, only. However, I was able to use the charger with valet parking. Cost was 0-2hrs for $15.00. We took a stroll to the French Quarter while waiting."
This location is the worst! The parking lot is always full because it’s inside the lot of the hotel. Very busy since it’s the closest location to DIA. It’s also filthy here. The parking spots always have trash and spilled food or drinks. The charging is also very slow here no matter the stall.  Do better Tesla.
This location is very challenging to locate!
"This location was part of a huge shopping plaza complex. Steps to food and shopping options while we waited for the car to charge. Lots of spaces available so that was very convenient. Since we stopped here in the afternoon, it was a good location to use and leave the car unattended while charging."
This looked like a house not a charger for public use.
This looks like a brand new location nice and fast .
This may be my favorite supercharger. The truck stop is very comfortable. Parking is abundant and easy to navigate. The truck stop also has Wi-Fi That's reachable from the supercharger. I wish Tesla would install superchargers at more truck stops like this.
"This may be my favorite Tesla Supercharger!  It's in such a perfect place.  And after a relaxing walk to the Sundial Bridge, to enjoy the views and wildlife, your car will be fully charged."
"This may be nice in the day but not at night.  Females driving alone might want to skip this stop.  Luckily I was with my family but I still felt
Uneasy.  It was clean and all charging stations were available.  No bathrooms or anything open. Would I stop again; only in the day.  Better than nothing un a middle of nowhere but Tesla sure needs to step up the bathroom stops since charging takes time."
This might be the most popular super charger on the east coast… Would be much better if it was a 250 kW charger for faster charging and less congestion at peak times. Also could use a coffee shop just a little closer.
"This NOT a public charging station. It is private property. If you use it, your car will be booted or towed."
"This on the rooftop of Target’s parking. Do not use Tesla navigation!!! It takes you to nowhere. Use google map, much more useful."
"This one is a few traffic lights away from the highway, but not too bad.  Standard Sheetz amenities, but not much greenspace for dog walks. Watch for bumps on your way in!"
"This one is in Fuel City's parking lot so if you like great street tacos you are going to love this station.
Keep up the good work Elon!"
This one is inside of the parking lot. You have to drive around to the back. The map has it wrong.
"This one is pretty new. Faster charging, next to a Safeway and Dairy Queen and McDonald’s. Well lit and clean"
"This one of the only chargers we have used that is in a covered area, which may be great in bad weather!  Security is excellent as it is in city hall building. Restrooms are inside downstairs.  Downside is that charging location is a little hard to find and chargers are on third floor."
This one seems a little slow at least today. Says it’s 150kw but only getting 64k max. Not mad about it but just something to keep in mind if your picking one in the Indy area.
"This one wasn't working when I was there this morning at 6:30am and I received a message saying ""equipment error"""
"This parking garage Supercharger station reminds me of a scene from a distopian movie. It's huge with about 21 chargers. If you need to stretch your legs, there's a Publix and shops above and within walking distance. As you enter the parking garage don't dismay, the first two hours are free. You should be charged and ready within that window of time."
"This particular destination charger is inside the golf course which closes if its dark.. in the winter the particular golf court closes by 4:00 Pm and its difficult for Tesla owners to charge at the stations where they close and chargers made not accessible..

Please get the chargers to the location where everyone can have access 24/7 thats what public chargers mean to be..
and its only place on midlothian where Tesla charger is available"
This place always has chargers available and is pretty fast! Gas station is nice and convenient and they have a diner on the inside. Great nature area to walk around in to get some fresh air and stretch your legs.
"This place is always empty. Slow speed, stopped here twice during our trip to Maine. It’s well lit and spacious."
"This place is always open and the gas station has a good selection of food, a coffee shop, a place to sit and eat or do work and the bathrooms are clean.

The chargers are also fast and close to the highway. This is a regular charging spot and would be good for long distance travelers."
"This place is better than the 3-stall station at the Mall.  It has more stalls and the grocery store means food and restrooms.  The hours of operation are better, too."
"This place is great for shoppers, not for travelers.

I would not recommend this location if you're in a rush or driving along the I-15. This isn't the place where you want to stop, even though it has 250kw chargers.

I think this location is meant for shoppers of the outlet. There is a ticketing booth that will charge for parking (for non-Nevada residents, as of 2023). Tesla supercharger users can enter/leave without paying, but you'll have to request for the gate to be opened.

It's not scenic, it's not necessarily convenient unless you're a shopper, and there's that annoying bit about possibly paying for parking or waiting for an attendant to open the gate.

The chargers themselves work and the location seems great for locals/shoppers. There are plenty of food choices, restrooms, and things to do while you wait.

I just need to emphasize that this location is not recommended for travelers; rather, it is perfect for shopping that takes between 30mins - 1 hr."
This place is in the Meijer parking lot.
This place is not safe even during day time. Homeless people are just sleeping near the charging stations. One of the guys even rushed into the car to ask for money! I would recommend everyone to avoid this charging station if you are on a long trip. Place is just among no where. There is no security here. Charge at your own risk!
"This place is really spectacular.  Quiet, calm, directly on the river - and best of all, POWERED BY COAL!    Bet the greenies didn't see that one coming.  Of course, 39%~40% of our electric power comes from Coal, even now.  Stay tuned.  That won't be replaced easily."
"This place is terrible.  Stopped at the hotel for the night, because they have destination chargers.  The chargers were in the dark…overhead parking lot light burned out.  Neither charger worked.   One had a red light flashing, and the other was completely dead.  Also a junk car parked back there blocking chargers.  267 dollars for the night at the hotel, and it smelled bad.   Don’t stop here!!!   Go to the super charger down the road."
This place is very crowded and it is very inconvenient to visit after passing the 35th Highway.  A lot of time is owned and there is even a charge limit.  There are also only 5 charging stations.
This place never has more than 1 car at it. Restrooms at the nearby gas stations however.
This place often has lines now its so busy. And there's 1 parking spot in the line up that doesn't actually have a charger assigned to it so people reverse into it and immediately switch spots.
"This place was crowded! I think I got the last charger available, but people do tend to come and go since this is at a mall."
This SC is located next to a steakhouse and walking distance from other restaurants and stores.
"This seems to be a very congested Telsa Supercharger port. Be aware, you won't get a full charge here on most days because of its popularity. My suggestion is, unless you have to you may want to go to another location."
This Sheetz have good options for food decent restrooms and plenty of parking. I have been this supercharger 4times and always not very busy and relatively fast charging.
"This should not even be counted. It is only for guests, and they tried to charge me 30$ to use it for a few minutes."
"This site has consistently only charged at 71 kilowatts. And , yes I’m aware of the fact that it’s an older 150 kilowatt station that does sharing between the same numbered stalls, and that can drop you in half. But that’s not the case. You can can the only one there with an almost empty battery and still only pull 71 kilowatts.  We drive from salt lake to Saint George about three times a month and this station is such a pain."
"This site has recently been expanded from 6 to 12 stalls.  All seem in good shape.  There's a Cracker Barrel next door, but other food options are quite a hike away."
"This site was s still under construction so in spite of what is stated on Tesla’s site, there is not yet a restroom or beverages. There IS, however, the porta potty being used by construction workers so that’s good. Love the fast chargers. 6/24/2022"
"This spot was a little difficult to find, blink and you’ll miss it. It is conveniently located behind the Quality Inn hotel. It took a bit of time to charge however, don’t fret just go and have yourself a nice meal. There are a few in walking distance. Happy travels and smile 💃🏽"
"This station always has spots available, and you can get Pepe's pizza or Taco Bell while you charge. There was a Dunkin Donuts, but it is closed for renovations."
"This station charged very fast and it was not very busy. The rate is lower than other charging station and there is no peak time (0.28 per kilowatt)

The venue is occupied with furniture stores, Bed Bath & Beyond, fast food restaurant, massaging store, and gun shooting range."
This station is located behind the Black Bear diner and is not visible from the main road. There is not a pull in charging station for those towing trailers or bike racks. Everything was clean and in working order.
"This station is located between 2 hotels. There aren't any dedicated food establishments next to the supercharger, but there are a couple options a short walk away. Station 3A was charging slowly so I switched to 3B and that was better."
"This station is located in the Meijer parking lot. We were traveling so decided to go past the station & picked up Firehouse Subs to go. We ate in the car while charging, and were able to get out & stretch our legs a little.  Wish there was a trash can nearby... closest one we found was up at store entrance"
This station is off the beaten path. Neighborhood is not great and really no place to walk dogs.  There are locations far more convenient to I-65 and  I-10 right at exit 1.
This station is ok. It has a bad habit of slowing to about 12kw once you get to 80% also the power will cost you about $20 a full charge in a model 3 single motor. Also usually their is an opening at this location as well.
This station is only available to charge if you are staying at the hotel.
This stop is not to far from Hwy35.  The worst part of this stop is no grass area to walk dogs.  You can cross the parking lot and use grass by Arby's.  Arby's is close with an easily accessible bathroom.  No issues with chargers
"This stop is probably our favorite south of Orlando. We charged at 80kW 342 mi/hr. There are 8 super chargers with 4 parking spots on both sides of the chargers. Plenty of space to go for a walk along the sidewalk while you wait. About fifty steps away is the Crafty Crab seafood boil restaurant that’s absolutely delicious. Also if you need a restroom, you can order a coke at their bar."
This stop is well maintained and multiple chargers. There are a couple food options in the strip to stretch your legs and use the restroom.
"This stop, is very easy to access, great for photos, and has a lot of great spots to eat at such a steak ‘n Shake and Texas Best Smokehouse. Sets I’m here in the morning I was easily able to pick up some breakfast items such as fruit cups but if you arrive here doing lunch or even dinner, your belly will be satisfied."
This Super Charger in Hamilton Place was east to find and new! Also if in the area to charge during daytime the mall is right there for shopping and rest rooms.
"This super charger is near the interstate, however they are currently doing construction and had to take some back roads to go north on I-55. Hopefully will be finished soon. It was not too far out of the way and gps guided us around easily. The restaurant nearby is very close and convenient for restrooms an hotel  and food. Also if you’re driving in from the North on I-55 there is no off ramp so GPS with guide you to get off a few miles north of where the chargers are. I almost passed up the guided exit thinking there would be an off ramp ahead but the GPS guided correctly. I visited this location twice both times no wait for charging. 150kw and 250kw is 20 miles or so away in Cape Giradeau."
"This super charging station is usually pretty empty and it is in a safe area with shops around to buy food and beverages, supplies and spend time while the tesla is charging up."
"This supercharger always has gas vehicles in the charging spots.  While some are only present for a few minutes, several park here for long periods of time. The charging area should be further from the door to the Wawa. I suspect the charging spots are being used as employee parking."
"This supercharger had a rough day yesterday. With 40+ people visiting in the 4.5 hours I was there, it had 2 out of 8 stalls that couldn't seem to stay cool. The fan in the #3 cabinet wasn't running like the others and they were intermittent all afternoon. One other plug (1B) would work fine with some cars, but not others. It wasn't a normal day though, our group was headed to Starbase after the gigafactory party in Austin earlier this week."
"This supercharger has ONLY 8 stalls and during peak hours cost .58 per kw hr! However, this shares parking lot with gas station w/ restrooms."
"This supercharger is a little confusing to get to, but I'm glad it's here! It's in the Holiday Inn parking garage, which is accessible from W 1st Street. The supercharger is on level 4, but you enter on level 3 so you technically only have to go up one level. There are a couple of signs once you get into the ramp. At the top take a right and there are 4 superchargers! You end up driving on the left side in the parking garage, which is quite confusing. Visit the Holiday Inn front desk to get your parking validated. There are lots of restaurants in the area - I highly recommend Lyric!"
This supercharger is advertised as up to 250kW but I can never get a charge above 30kW. It’s SOOOOO slow. I’ve tried every stall and the slow charge is the same. Luckily the Shell folks are super nice and the burgers are really good.
"This Supercharger is always where I charge up going from Portland to Bend. Located in the Fred Meyer garden center parking lot there is ample open parking nearby. Fred Meyer does a good job of keeping the lot clean and safe. The gas station is within view of the chargers making this a safer location. The bathrooms are located inside the building by the cash registers and are cleaned regularly. Inside the store there are ample drink and snack options for a long road trip. The chargers are in very good shape. I've never had a problem with a charger here not working or a cracked charge plug.

There are other chargers for electrics that don't use the Tesla plug nearby. If Tesla opens the Supercharger network to all electrics in the US I doubt it will affect the capacity at this Supercharger for Tesla vehicles. This will keep this station relevant for years to come."
"This supercharger is at Tesla store. There are around 20 Tesla chargers, speed is pretty decent. We stopped here to charge on the way back from Tahoe. Really convenient location, Target is next to this charger"
"This supercharger is at the Hampton Inn. They don’t mind you going in to buy snacks from them, but they won’t allow you to use their restrooms. The man working the desk was so unbelievably rude when we used the restrooms and told us not to come back."
This supercharger is at the Kansas Turnpike rest stop oasis which is quite convenient. One does not even need to get off the turnpike and it has a full gas station/convenience store with restrooms.
"This supercharger is good. Right next to Wawa. It became very busy during the last year, though. You may need to wait in the line, especially on Saturday morning"
"This Supercharger is in Goshen, CA- not Visalia. It’s a convenient location, right off Highway 99. There is a travel plaza that has Subway, Starbucks with lots of room, a convenience store, and RESTROOMS with shower. There is also a Burger King nearby and a dog walk. Only downside: Chargers don’t seem to charge at 250 🤷🏽‍♀️"
"This supercharger is in the parking lot of Hy-Vee grocery. If you visit during the day, you MUST go to the Market Grille inside the grocery store (near the deli counter). They have beer and great food! The burger was great quality OMG! The bartender told us breakfast is also great. They have $4 mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ. This is our 6th time visiting this supercharger on a road trip and I’m sad we are just now discovering the Market Grille."
"This supercharger is in the parking lot of La Quinta Inn, pretty easy to spot. There is a McDonalds across the street. Stopped there twice, charging was fast even when a few other cars were charging."
"This supercharger is in the perfect location. There's a Panera, Target, and Costco in walking distance. I usually walk to target and shop while my car charges."
This supercharger is in the subterranean parking near the Nordstrom. Google maps takes you one level up.  Nearby Elevator or staircase takes up up one level to surface.
This supercharger is located behind a Kahill’s restaurant and next to a dumpster. There are no bathrooms or anyplace to grab a bite unless it’s between 4-10 pm and you want to go inside. I drove past the driveway and had to turn around. The overflowing dumpster is gross and it would be very dark and remote at night. Skip this charger if you’re heading south and catch one in NC.
This supercharger is located in the downtown of Ukiah. In the daytime I felt safe it was a little confusing to get to and I felt a little nervous that I didn’t know where I was going or if this town even had a supercharger but it does there’s not many superchargers but it’s not a credit one there are eight superchargers. I see a small park and little local businesses but nothing where you can go get food or use the restroom. If I was here at night I’d probably feel a little nervous. Unless I was with someone that is from this area. I definitely would come again and I’m super grateful for the supercharger as there’s not many when you start heading north from the Santa Rosa area. There is a trashcan right here in the parking lot which was very nice a lot of superchargers did not have trash cans but again like I said there was no public restroom that I can see within a few steps away.
"This Supercharger is nice. There are plenty of bays to charge plus it is located at a mall so you can do a little bit of shopping or eat at one of the restaurants in the area while you wait.  Near the closest entrance to the mall from the supercharger there is a restroom, but the mall doesn't open until 10am most days, so if you arrive earlier you may be out of luck."
This supercharger is not working since 3 weeks. Please charge your car before visiting Tenaya Lodge! They do have 2 level 2 chargers but difficult to get.
"This supercharger is ok with serval spots to eat but would be much better if it was located in Tigertown which is much closer to the interstate, although I know the area I don't always want to drive so far off the interstate to recharge otherwise it's great"
This supercharger is on a Buc-ee’s parking lot so it is super convenient.
"This supercharger is one that I love to drive past and never use, but that I'm very glad exists when I need it. For travelers along highway 1, no doubt taking the detour into Maple Creek is inconvenient at best - but sometimes the only option to make the stretch between Medicine Hat and Swift Current.

The first time I ever needed this charger was on a very cold winter night with strong headwinds that made skipping it untenable. Regardless of the weather, the chargers were reliable as ever, full 250kW output, and near enough to amenities in the town (not that any were open at that time).

The proximity to the co-op windshield cleaning supplies, garbage cans, and facilities are fantastic for road trips as well."
This Supercharger is perfect for a mid-trip stop. The Woodmans Grocery Store is huge and open 24 hours. I didn't see any hotels near by. That's why I think it's best for mid-trip stops.
"This Supercharger is reliable, with very quick access to/from the highway. I frequent this location and never have to wait, even on holidays. Royal Farms has decent coffee, chicken and snacks."
"This supercharger is situated in Holiday Mart parking lot. Very convenient for a quick snack as they also have a deli which opens at 10am when we were there. There were tons of chargers, one perfect for vehicles that are hauling a trailer. Restroom is inside the store next to the deli.

Be attentive of the surroundings, there was a deer walking by on the empty lot. 😊"
"This supercharger is the only thing that has brought me to the South Shore Plaza in years. Enter up the garage ramp next to the old Sears. Then drive all the way to the garage wall on the left. 8 stalls, and usually I find a availability. The closest mall entrance has bathrooms right inside the door. Target is a quick walk inside and escalator down for errands while you charge.
*I have updated and taken a star away for inconsistent charging levels. Check to make sure your vehicle is charging at an acceptable level before walking away. Today I had trouble with both 1B and 2A before finding a decent charge at 1A for my MS."
"This supercharger is tucked away between the Petro building and the large truck stop, hard to see until you are right on it.

Otherwise just what you would expect. Several restaurants and fast food nearby."
"This supercharger is tucked behind a strip mall. I tried a couple stalls and I could never get more than 90kW on my model 3, which feels very slow after being accustomed to 140kW+. There are lots of good food options here which is nice. I also couldn't get an internet connection to my car so theater mode wasn't available. I'd recommend trying to skip this supercharger."
"This Supercharger is usually not very busy, and it's right next to a kids playground and a convenience store with nice bathrooms and a restaurant. A good stop along the Trans-Canada for Tesla drivers!"
This supercharger is very close to the turnpike. It is located behind the Wendy's. The Wendy's is very clean and the bathrooms are newly renovated. There isn't much else to walk to while you wait and the parking lot had tons of pot holes which is why I gave 4 stars.
This supercharger is very convenient for vacation travel in and around Panama City resort beaches.  It is located along Route 98 in a fuel station/convenience store lot (Bee's).
This supercharger location has never been full in my experience. The bathroom at New Earth Market is clean and the endcap near the registers usually has a fancy chocolate bar that interests me.
This supercharger location is in a busy plaza adjacent to a busy Wawa. Be sure to park on the side away from the Wawa so you can pull out as the traffic leaving both Wawa and the plaza merge and bottleneck.
"This Supercharger site really needs some TLC. It's hidden away and set in the absolute pitch dark! No overhead lights or lights on the charging station itself, aside from the dim Tesla Red glow.
I did not feel safe AT ALL at this location."
"This Supercharger Station happens to be one of the closest to my apartment (so I may be biased). However, it's conveniently located next to several shopping marts, which includes, Ross, Marshalls, Traders Joe's and Banana Republic. It's also about a 7 minute walk from Emeryville Bay Street which also has places for you to shop. I usually come to this spot after 7pm and generally can find a spot available. There's only been one time (my first time charging my Tesla) that I had to wait for a stall to open. All in all I love the location and quickness of the charges. I highly recommend utilizing this station as a ""get some errands done"" station."
"This supercharger station has 8 charging bays and is close to a Casey's General Store. The Casey's makes going to the bathroom and getting a snack possible. Beware, this Casey's only has two bathrooms and is nothing in comparison to a Love's stop. But Ms. Bonnie, a Casey's employee, was very nice and welcoming and I was glad I went in to use the bathroom and fill up on snacks."
This supercharger station is one of the biggest Tesla supercharger stations I've seen in the area. If your having issues finding Tesla supercharger stations. Go on your navigation and press the charger button. It will show you the closets Tesla supercharger and what charging capacity it has! Auburn hills is the strongest.
This supercharger stop is great. It is easy to get snacks and walk the dog. The nearby hotel has clean bathrooms. Overall a pleasant experience.
"This supercharger was a lifesaver after being parked at the airport for a week in cold weather (I think we arrived at the charger with 3%). Based on other reviews, I was a little worried about slow charging speeds but I got ~140kw the entire time, even with 3-4 other cars there.

We had a hitch mounted carrier and were able to back in and still reach the charging cable. There were two chargers that you could use even if you had a trailer attached.
Also, the hotel attendant didn't even question us when we went inside looking for restrooms.

So I think overall a good spot. As always, more amenities like food/snacks would be better, but I think from a family perspective this one is pretty great. I could imagine even letting kids run around inside the hotel lobby on bad weather days."
This supercharger was open but wasnt working properly. It worked at first but then dropped dramatically. It was strange because it said 45 minutes to charge but it took over an hour and half.
"This Tesla charger is in St Charles, Missouri. Although the charge is slower than the faster super chargers it charges at around 75kw there are a lot of shops nearby. It was a little difficult to find because there are two charging locations. The Tesla chargers are on the 1st floor of the multilevel parking garage. Very good location."
This Tesla Charger needs more stations. We had 2 people ahead of us in the line to charge.
This Tesla charging station does not provide 150kwh it starts with 90/80ish which is not cool. They should put 100KWH in the system so people know.
"This Tesla destination charger is located in the Delta parking lot of Opryland resort. It's free to use for overnight guests. It's 16kw in power.
The connector is beat up and cracked but still works.
You'll be lucky to find an empty space to charge though between the ICEr friends and fellow charger users."
This Tesla destination slow charger saved me today!  Without it I would not have been able to make it back to Phx.  It will give me enough juice to get to the Super Chargers in Cordes Junction.  THANK YOU for the FREE charge Tesla!  SAVED ME!  ***It charges at 25miles per hour
This Tesla Supercharger has saved my life twice now. Thank Elon for having this charger on the FL Turnpike. When it comes to this turnpike I’ve taken the wrong entrance twice and for whatever reason the cars GPS tells me I can’t get to it without taking the whole turnpike and turn around to get to it. Not true you can get to it from both side whatever reason Tesla shows wrong. I would be SOL if I didn’t have these chargers saving me from a dumb mistake. I’m not one to stop or swerve around to endanger people around me. I made my choice which cost me…but only a little bit of my time. Thank goodness.
"This Tesla Supercharger is a little off the freeway traveling path, but well needed in the area. It is a great location to charge, not too busy in the area (for now), and right next to the New Earth Market. The market is a perfect stop while charging. It is a good place for a quick bite and shopping, with a seating area inside and outside. The Supercharger opened in February 2019 with 10 stalls for charging."
"This Tesla Supercharger is in a great location. This place has a Sheetz to get some great food, and a car wash to get your ride all Cleaned up after you're done charging. There's also a Wendy's within walking distance as well."
"This Tesla Supercharger is located at a Hy-Vee not too far from the interstate. I travel for work and I am often here on a weekly/bi-weekly basis. With frequently traveling through this area I can confidently say that I have never had to wait for a charger and typically if there are some cars at that location, people tend to space out nicely. With this being at a Hy-Vee, there is a Starbucks located on the inside as well as a Retaurant. Within the block radius there are a couple fast food options as well. The Hy-Vee also has some great grab and go options and drink selection. Lastly, this Hy-Vee location has clean restrooms. Overall, solid stop."
This Tesla supercharger Is located in Visalia California off of the highway 99 there is a Burger King Starbucks and a Chevron with a convenience store. There's also a seating area and pet relief area.
"This Tesla supercharger isn't as convenient to the highway as some other locations and there are fewer food or shopping options immediately adjacent to the charger. However, there is a restroom inside the Holiday Inn and you could pick up food on the way to the charger if you like combining a charging stop with mealtime."
"This Tesla supercharger location has 12, 250 kw charging stations (instead of the 6, 120 kw stations currently shown on Google maps). Very conveniently located right next to the Hampton inn and Cracker barrel restaurant. Always a good stop for a quick Tesla charge. Highly recommend."
"This Tesla Supercharger location in Columbia, Missouri has been completely full the last few times I've driven between Saint Louis and Kansas City.  It would be nice to have another location between here and St Louis.  There are multiple options between Columbia and KC.

Jimmy John's is across the street and a gas station very nearby without sidewalks to it.  Otherwise everything else seems to be across the highway or 3-5 miles down the highway."
"This Tesla Supercharger location is in a great spot. It is right off of route 1 and easy to see and access. In addition to the Panera there are other places to stop at without having to cross any streets, you would just be walking through the giant parking lot. This includes Costco, Target,  and the Greene Turtle Sports Bar and Grill. I was also able to get 120 kW of charging which equated to around 450 mi/hr even with 3 other Tesla vehicles using the other stalls."
This Tesla Supercharger location is the best one in the Nashville Metro area. There are 12 V3 stalls that supercharge at rates up to 250kW are far superior to the slow ones at the Nashville Service Center. It’s conveniently located off I-65 in The Shops of Brentwood Hills in front of the Target. There are 4 ChargePoint J1772 chargers located there as well.
This Tesla supercharger location sits behind Target. Pretty easy to get there off of Brentwood Ave or enter the Promenade shopping area and go behind Target. They have off peak reduced rates between midnight and 8am at 17 cents per kWh and .38 cents any other time. It’s never too crowded at night. Safe area too.
"This Tesla Supercharger location was a little difficult to find but is actually a good location.   It is on the lower level of a parking garage so it is covered.  You have to enter the rental car gate, take a ticket and then charge vehicle.  Upon exit, go to line on left with an attendant and they will not charge you any parking fee.  This location has 8 bays and is busy.  The spaces are tighter than usual as this space is at a premium."
"This Tesla supercharger station has the most food friendly options. It’s within steps next to the Sushi, Korean BBQ and further steps away from the Panera and the Habit. All the stalls are at the 250 kw/hour."
"This Tesla Supercharger station is conveniently located, with readily available charging slots. While your vehicle charges, you can take a short walk to nearby stores to pick up a few items."
"This Tesla supercharger station is great! 12 brand new stalls in the parking lot of a Meijer in Detroit. I think this is the first and only supercharger station actually within the City of Detroit. In addition to Meijer there are plenty of sit down and fast food restaurants, as well as retail shopping. This will be my new go-to charging station."
This Tesla supercharger station is great.  They have plenty of Tesla  supercharger stations and don't have to wait.  The area is well lit and has plenty of charging stations.
"This Tesla supercharger station is in south part of Vallejo, CA. The place is a bit hidden in a remote corner and possibly dark at night. Apoears to not safe to charge at night or even on not busy days. Some stations have broken hooks that the charger will not latch or secure to the station and just left dangling on the ground."
"This Tesla Supercharger station is located right off Highway 55 and is located in the parking lot of a good Mexican restaurant (El Bracero).  The next closest restaurant is about a 10 minute walk.  8 Supercharging stations are available and both times I was there on a weekend, only half the chargers were being used so i had no wait."
"This the worst supercharger I’ve been to, people are super inconsiderate here. In my opinion, if you’re going to be at a supercharger and not stay in your car it defeats the purpose of it as other need to use it. The whole point of a supercharger is be a quick charge and then be done so the next person may use it. Leaving your car camping at one just takes away from the people who actually need it in a pinch. If you’re going to leave for a long period of time and explore Tivoli Village do everyone a favor and take the slower supercharger so those who actually just need a quick charge may use it."
This tyngsboro/Nashua charger is perfect for southern NH residents. When I visited 8 out of 12 were operational.
This unit is blocked by the owner of the house. She indicated that the charger was left by the previous owner of the home. I could use it when she left. The vehicle blocking it wasn’t an electric vehicle. Went by 3 more times. Still blocked.
"This used to be a nice supercharger stop, but now it is filthy, garbage cans full and garbage on the floor everywhere, reeks of urine. There are clearly people living in their cars and they seem to prefer to park close to the charging station. I feel bad for them, but it definitely makes this spot feel a lot shadier..
Also, the chargers seem a lot slower these days, thus prolonging the unpleasant wait here. Will pass on this stop next time"
This was a busy place last year when I was here.  Timing is everything.  Looks like they added a couple chargers since I was here last.
"This was a delightful Supercharger stop. Many Tesla owners might be surprised to be stopping at a Food Lion to plug in, but if you get past pre-conceptions, you'll find 12x fast (250kW) chargers here, and very friendly staff at the grocery store (we had one cashier very nicely ask us the usual questions about how long to charge, what's it like to drive, etc.) Bonus #1, the bathrooms at the Food Lion were super clean and well maintained. Bonus #2, being a grocery store, there's no shortage of snacks you can pick up here, plus they have Dunkin mochaccinos! #3 The Superchargers are in a less-usual, pull through configuration AND they're angle parking. That makes for a different look on your Instagram or something if you just have to share. Bonus #4: Trash and recycling are in easy reach at the storefronts. Bonus #5 The road is quiet enough you can easily walk to the KFC, Subway, McDonalds or Pizza Hut across the street. You're not hurting for choice here, as long as you arrive during store hours.

Oh yeah, and if you get bored of all that you can always peruse the booze selection at the bottle shop. Just don't drink before you go!"
This was a good place to charge  - very convenient and fast. There was a tech working there servicing all the charging stations at the time. That's nice to see.
"This was a great destination charger. It is located in the hotel's garage. It charged my Model 3 at ~40 mph. Since we were staying at this hotel, I just plugged it in overnight and we were all set each day."
"This was a great Tesla supercharger. Electricity came into my car extremely quickly. It took about 15 minutes to add 100 miles of range. By the time my wife came back to the car after visiting the bathroom, we were ready to continue our trip."
This was a nice stop especially if you like arbys. We actually wanted to walk so we went to the Home Depot to use their bathrooms. I’m getting good and resourceful for discovering bathrooms near the super chargers.
"This was a perfect place to stop! Outside of the city, and you don't have to exit the turnpike! These are located at the rest stop in between the north and southbound lanes of the turnpike.  I went in to use the restroom and the entire inside was bright and clean. The chargers are near the sou end of the parking lot and felt very safe. There is a nice green space behind the chargers to walk a dog. Very convenient, this will be my new regular stop instead of going on to Wichita!"
This was an excellent location. Lots of places to eat and shop. Fast charging.
"This was an ideal charging station. Great location that was spacious and near several businesses. There's a Target nearby with bathrooms and a Starbucks. However, even closer is a sub shop and Mexican restaurant. Charging speed was good. I had good experience here."
"This was my first experience with a supercharger. Honestly, I find it very convenient that it's placed right off 90 and easy to use. However, I was only checking it out for an upcoming trip.
Update: still a great supercharger, even after plenty of experience with them now."
This was not busy during weekend travel to Acadia. The Lonestar Steakhouse is a short walk.
This was not in service and I was routed here by Tesla navigation for a recharge only to find it wasn’t working and there was nothing identifying it as not working in Navigation or online. My car was too low on battery to drive to another supercharger so had to have my car towed. Was a huge pain and took hours to deal with. I’m hoping Tesla will identify chargers like this in the navigation in the future so drivers aren’t routed to non-working chargers like I was.
"This was our favorite stop on the drive from Portland, OR to Boise, ID! Fast charging, and a great place to watch the sunset! Walk to bathrooms at the Shell, restaurants nearby and if open, the Chamber of Commerce visitors center is right there!"
"This was our final charging station on our way home from a 2400 mile road trip. This trip has been a breeze. This supercharger station has 8 charging bays with one that allows front/forward drive-in. It's in the lot of a huge Double Tree. I was a bit worried about having to ask hotel personnel for permission restroom access, but my worry was unnecessary. When I entered, I was pleasantly surprised.  The entryway was actually to the hotel, the restaurant entry was to the left through another internal door and the restrooms were clearly marked to the opposite side with their own entries. The restroom was bright and clean. There were also a couple of seating areas within that side of the hotel if you need to wait for someone to finish up in the restroom, before exiting the building. I'm not sure if these doors remain open at night, but it was super convenient during the day."
This was removed. There is a standard Level 2 charger still there though.
This was such a rejuvenation for me. My friends invited to go and i was tired but i got there and i instantly felt recharged and invigorated. The food was great and i loved the atmosphere. A bit loud but that is a small complaint compared to the experience as a whole
This Wawa supercharging location is incredibly convenient located just off the Garden State Parkway. However when this parking lot gets busy it becomes extremely dangerous as there isn’t a whole lot of room to navigate.
"This Wawa was right off the turnpike exit.  There was a bunch of chargers here, I'm guessing about 12.  Well lit and a lot of space."
"Though it may be a little further into Nashville, this is the best station.  Usually there aren't too many people so charging speed it pretty good."
Though looks may be deceiving overall great experience. Right next to Winn Dixie if you need to use restroom or stock up on road trip snacks. Glad to see Tesla super chargers in quieter areas like Arcadia.
"Though we were charging, it's good to see a Sheetz drive thru. Lots of spaces and not very busy when we were there."
Thought this was a 250kw charger and was surprised that I maxed out around 150kw with a 30% soc. Turns out 150kw is 👍🏻👍🏻
"Three 200V/48A Tesla chargers, each one with two parking spots adjacent to them, labelled ""for electric vehicle use while charging"", right in front of the new Marriott Residence Inn (which is hidden behind the MOOYA Burgers, hard to see from the road).
Bad news is that since the chargers are the very best parking spots, right near the front door of the Residence Inn, IC vehicles like to park there. This evening two electric cars were charging, but the other spaces were filled up with IC vehicles.
Still, nice to see a charger at the Residence Inn. It would be a nice place to stay if you're visiting the hospital next door, the fairgrounds, or Baldwin Wallace University"
Three chargers not working as of 8/24/2022.  The one with the sign missing is completely dead. Two others start to charge but stop immediately  3b an 1B. 3a worked for me.   Hotel restroom was clean.
Three chargers on the side were not working but it wasn’t busy and we didn’t need to wait on a weekday. Lots of food options and stores
Three Functional Tesla Chargers. 16KW. Nice to see them popping up in various hotels. They could use some signage to indicate parking for EV charging only. Friendly hotel staff said they are already working on getting signs. Cool! Thanks.
Three or four chargers that all work well. The only problem is that people don't respect that the spots are reserved for electric vehicles only.
"Three restaurants (Buffalo Wild Wings, Ramen, and a local bar/Pizza restaurant). Bathrooms in restaurants, bike shop, and lobby of 901 Pier View Drive (open until 5:00PM). Next to the Snake River."
Three Tesla Level 2 chargers and one J1772. All free. There is a cafe inside with food and beer/wine or you can sit outside on the patio overlooking the valley while you get a charge.
Three Tesla Level 2 chargers and one J1772. Great place for a charge. You can take an extended hike or sit inside (or outside) at the excellent and spacious visitor center where there is plenty of comfortable seating. There is also a restaurant.
Thrilled about this addition. (8) 250kw chargers. Behind the Circle K / Churches drive thru.
"Thrilled to find another 250 charger at a Buc-ee's!!!  Thus one is new, the Tesla guy we ran in to, said...  5/3/23

Can't beat Buc-ees for clean bathrooms, and tons of food, drinks and gifts."
Thx for the juice!!
"TIL ppl reviewed Supercharger stations. Oh well, here I go.

This place isn't too far off I-5 so good job Tesla team on placement. There's a gas station about 50 yards across. Which is kinda distant yet close enough for you and its ICE patrons to awkwardly stare at each other while having imaginary conversations/confrontations in your head.

There were plenty of open stalls when I arrived, midday on a weekend. I was able to peak at 530-ish mph.

Oh, and there's a nice patch of astroturf in the middle which just made the whole charging experience feel even more fancy. I did, however, see - at the same time - a dog relieving himself on one end and a woman doing yoga barefoot on the other. Do what you wish with this info."
Tim Hortons and nice truck stop
"To be honest I’ve rarely found any Tesla supercharging stations, except maybe in Yonkers and New Rochelle New York, that deserved anything less than five star, but this one definitely deserves five star because of his vicinity to Dave’s Fresh Market which is pretty much a Wegmans on steroids. You must must must stop here if you’re in Rhode Island."
To crowded one Charger was not working.they need to work on timing middle if the turnpike we need to charge full every 20 min charging restated.
"To educate the unaware; At this super charger station you have Stall's A&B which SHARE 150kw. If you park next to someone in a B stall with A occupied you will both lose charging speed down to about 75kw. If there are still other spots open, It is proper etiquette to make an attempt to do so. Obviously if there are no more to spaces open no big deal!
As far as the location it's good, coffee and famous Pepe's pizza, area looks clean currently."
To use this you have to eat at this restaurant and there are cars parked to block you as well.Owner told me he will tow your car if you leave it there. Food not that exciting to use this. Try sth lake dr near by.
"Today I did my first “big” trip in my Tesla model 3 and found this charging station to be a bit off the beaten path. It’s located behind a Weis grocery store. I’m not sure I would like to be back here by myself in the evening.
But the chargers work fine. When I pulled up there was 3 other cars already charging so I felt safe."
"Today, January 21st, 2023. Tesla Supercharger working. Just come, the chargers are working. The Tesla computer car is not showing that the station is operational but it is working and it had been like this since last Friday ."
"Tons of stalls, tons of places to get food or go to the bathroom nearby."
Tons of supercharger spots. Charges at ~230 mph. Parking is only $3 / hour. This is the best charging spot you'll find in the entire NYC / Jersey City area.
Tons to do while charging. Great place to stop if heading to northern Wisconsin. I gave it 4 stars because it only has 3 plugs. It’s the first 3 plug I have seen. Normally I see 5-6 at a Supercharger.  But it’s a great location.
Too bad they built the Arby's across the street. It occludes my view of the coal fired power plant providing the energy to charge my car. #savingtheworld.🤣🤣
"Too few chargers, four, for such a busy place. If you haven't set a distant location for your destination in the navigation system, the system may, as it did to us, cap the charge at 80%. That's too tight to get to the next charger south at Farmington. You can manage northbound as there are chargers in Green River and Price. Moab's chargers are in a hotel parking lot, the visitors center is  nearby as are restaurants, a great bookstore--Back of Beyond Books, and all sorts of shops."
Too much afternoon traffic getting to this charger - further from the highway and charger is busier than most. Several busy and slow intersections. Would recommend finding another.
Too slow to be a practical charging stop.  6 mi/hr on Model S 100D is very poor especially when I can get 4 mi/hr on a 120v wall outlet with a 50 ft extension cord.  This is not worth going out of your way.
Too slow.  Only car here and it’s doing 75kw or 336mi per hr
Took a few minutes for speed to improve. Wish it was a little faster but at least not painfully slow. Plenty of stores to browse as well as some fast food to eat
Took me a while to actually find the supercharger. To save everyone time it’s inside the parking garage on the 3rd I believe. It has a nice grocery store with elevators so you could do a grocery run. Stays nice and lit up over night but for visibility and ease of access I can’t give this more than 3 stars
Topped out at 127kW. 8 stalls.
"Total of 3 chargers on the same circuit. When other vehicles are plugged in, charging time goes down significantly, but still fast. Last night we started with 22mi/hr on the Model 3 but that raised to 38 when the other cars finished charging and we got the full 42Amps."
"Totally blows my mind that this is here, 4 free 220v Tesla chargers. Stopped for an hour to get topped off, just plugged right in and went shopping."
Totally fine- not much in terms of restaurants or stores around but there is a gas station. We charged a bit and got a snack to get us to Missoula which is better for a meal/longer stop.
"Tower 2C never gave more than 36 kW, even with no one else plugged in.  Decided to experiment by trying a different tower, 1A immediately pushed 120 kW against battery around 50%."
"Trash can and window cleaning brush included at this location. Food options are limited to the Royal Farms, gas station, convenience store."
Traveling across the country stayed in Rock springs last night charging up around 7 am There is a little coffee shop in parking lot next to charger  found the local people to be very friendly. I went to the Smith's grocery store to use the bathroom it was very clean
Trickle charger.  You get about 7 mi/hr.  Do not come here for a destination charge.
Tricky location. Where your GPS takes you if you put in the address is actually in the parking lot across the road. The chargers are placed right across the street on E Irving. Plenty of chargers and giving me 31ml/hour. 👍
"Tried 2 chargers when 17deg F, and both were frozen. Got nervous because I was at 5% with no other charging option available on Christmas day. Fortunately the 3rd charger worked. Images are of the chargers and plugs that didn't work. Not sure how to report this to Tesla."
Tried a few stalls.  Couldn't get more than 35-40kw with only 1 other car there.  Dunkin donuts and jersey Mike's and a decent bagel shop in this lot.  Go up the hill to Delizia for great pizza.
"Tried out new 250kW supercharger. Not getting close to the max charging. Started at 85kW, then down to 65kW after just a few minutes. Getting average of 50kW. Location is not nice and very sketchy activities going on. Started charging around 8:20pm."
Tried to charge my new S Plaid here today and the giant pothole next to the charger curb rashes 2 of my wheels.
Tried to use these destination chargers and they were completely iced. Very little signage around the fact that there were chargers meant for Teslas.
True 250kW charger. I go and charge for 15 minutes and I’m ready for the day. I like to get food nearby and charge my car while I eat. It’s usually never busy so that’s great. Love coming here!
Try a diff stall if you get lower rates. My last review got taken down cause I plugged an RV site between this and Great Falls. But if you get range anxiety you can get 10-20% there with a Nema 14-50 or TT-30 RV adapters while you get dinner at the gas station diner nearby. Or get an RV site and charge for $25 a night at 15-40 miles/hr.
"Try to avoid using unless have no time to charge at home. Usually full so slower charging, some stations not working causing confusion with in/out versus moving to working charger. In a rather secluded area of hotel Parking lot which I would not feel comfortable using alone at night. I could understand if this was just a remote highway stop but there are so many shopping complexes in Greenville located right off highway more convenient as this site. Don’t expect a quick stop unless off hours."
"Trying to actually get to the chargers is a challenge. The car routed me into the parking garage and you can't make a direct left to the chargers. I had to go to the second floor, turn around, then the parking attendant had me make a u-turn in the exit lane to drive the wrong way to the chargers. I hope you all have better luck. The chargers seem to be in the valet Parking lot. Plenty of spaces though."
"Tucked away behind a burm so there's no way to see it from the road if your coming from E.Aurora Rd. To find this Tesla Supercharger go twards the Hobby Lobby turn immeadtly to the left twards the Outback the chargers are located between the Ohio Savings Bank and the Key Bank. OUTBACK IS OPEN TILL 11 most nights so it's always a place to eat if you're traveling but this exit is a target rich environment for whatever you need, in evidence the plethora  of pick ups, sport utility vehicles  and mini-vans filling the Hobby lobby lot but on Sundays."
"Tucked away in back, but very fast.  No other cars while I was there"
"Tucked away in the shade behind the gas station. Right next to a carnival type train track. Also a nice grassy area for the kids to play right next to it. However, if you have more time walk towards the train you see past the grassy patch, and there is a playgriund over there for the kids to play."
"Tucked away off 95, not much nearby except Fred Meyer. Large pothole you'll want to look out for otherwise unremarkable. Rates may fluctuate but it's been $.34kw/h for the last few charges. 6 spots in a row with a 7th meant for use if you have a trailer or hitch mounted bike rack I suppose."
Tucked out of the way but still convenient to some food and shopping in the nearby T&D. Do NOT recommend for those towing. Very tight and narrow parking lot. All are v3 250kW chargers.
Turn into the Baymont Hotel.  You’ll feel like your at the back of the hotel when you turn in. Follow the entry way to the backside with the Mexican Restaurant in your sight.  You’ll have to walk through the grass to get over to the restaurant but it is very close.  We didn’t have time to go grab a bite but it looked like a nice place.
Two 48Amp Tesla chargers.
Two bays out but still showing available on the map so people just kept coming. We ended up doing *just* enough to get to the next charger 30 miles away. The auto-router had left us here without enough reserve charge to get to the next one without charging at least a little. It's near a mall so normally it would be nice:  I'm mostly being salty about the Tesla auto-router not communicating with the Tesla maintenance crews.
Two chargers available and a great bar with an amazing view!
"Two chargers that are open to use on the side of the parking lot. One is a Tesla charger, the other is a charge point charger for which you'd need an adapter for Tesla."
"Two chargers: one Tesla & one generic charging unit. Front desk states first come, first serve but will unplug vehicle (even without a key, I didn’t realize that was possible) to charge other vehicles without notice or sufficient charge. Think twice on relying on this charger until hotel and valet put a policy in place to handle the quantity of electric vehicles. On a busy winter weekend hotel was flustered with 4 Tesla’s staying on property."
"Two fast superchargers in relatively good repair. This service plaza has big surges of activity, and when it does these two Tesla supercharger spaces are frequently taken or obstructed by conventional/internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, aka ICE'd. This is a big inconvenience given that it takes 30 to 40 minutes to get a decent charge, despite the very fast charger. I hope the plaza management can come up with an enforcement policy to protect these spaces for Teslas, especially once all those Model 3's hit the road!"
"Two J1772 chargers just across the lot from the Tesla chargers, free and working fine! Nice boost before hitting the mountains going to Dunsmuir..."
"Two Level 2 Clipper Creek and two Tesla Level 2 chargers free usage, 24 hours. I have used the Clipper Creek charger and it is faster than my home charger"
"Two level 2 destination chargers available, limited to 30 amp. While not a fast charger, it's sufficient to top off while enjoying a meal here and highly appreciated. Thank you Sierra Nevada Brewing!"
Two of four Tesla chargers are broke. One of the connectors is physically broke and the other isn’t powered. Used the non-Tesla charger and it put out 16 amps at 200V….take a day to charge an X.
Two of the three are ICED.
"Two sets of TESLA superchargers, in the parking structure’s FREE parking. Shopping, restaurants, movie theatre and a grocery store all in one convenient location minutes from I-94."
Two stations were not working. It was a cold day and there was a big line to charge.
Two Superchargers that are tucked away from the main roads.  We recharged our Model 3 there a couple of times with no problems.  They are co-located outside a hotel so restrooms and a restaurant (Taco Palenque I believe) are available.
Two Tesla 8kw chargers and One GE charger.  Both Tesla chargers work as advertised.
Two tesla and two J-1772 all available and working!
Two Tesla and two J1772 chargers. Used the J1772 and got ~7.5 kW. Good luck and enjoy the area!
"Two Tesla chargers and a J1772. It can be confusing at first to find them. Location on the map is wrong. It is on the first level of the parking garage behind the Marriott. Note that the entrance to the Marriott is on the second level, and there are no internal ramps to drive between the second and first level. There is a staircase just to the right of the chargers though. Enter the garage near the BBQ restaurant, none of the spots are marked EV and will probably be ICE’d. If you’re staying at the Marriott, wait until about 9pm and try again, by that time the restaurant isn’t as busy and you should be able to get a spot."
"Two Tesla chargers and one charger for other ev. These are the lowest kW possible. Takes hours to recharge. With all the traffic, this town desperately needs a super charging station. I got the only available spot midday, thankfully I got there when I did bc shortly thereafter Tesla after Tesla drove by looking to charge. It took me hours (like 3 and a half hours), and yet I was the first to leave. Truly insane. Important to mention, these charging spots are only for hotel guests. I was not a guest and charged anyways without any obvious issue but I can imagine it becoming one bc the hotel is paying for these charges (I didn’t pay).

I called around trying to find a car dealership or car rental agency in hopes one might have a charging station. There is not one place besides the heat hotel. THIS IS ALL THERE IS.

Tesla drivers - download the third party charging apps (ChargePoint and PlugShare) as this will show at least a couple other possible chargers.

**Nissan dealership said they were installing some, hopefully this is completed soon. Called 05/27/22**"
Two Tesla chargers and one Clipper Creek.
Two Tesla chargers at the back of the Homewood Suites. Used while on a road trip and was fully charged by morning.
"Two Tesla chargers, great spot for hiking, biking, etc! Thanks for the juice! ⚡⚡"
Two Tesla chargers. Used for slow overnight charging (12A) and worked great. Signs state “Reserved for electric cars only” and observed EVs parked but not charging. Hotel employee’s hybrid Elantra in a Tesla spot - Hotel does not care.
"Two Tesla charging stations. One had the charging cable zip tied which, I guess, means inop. Plugged the second one in and nothing happened.
Worthless."
Two Tesla destination chargers that get you 48kwh of charge.  Great that a place like this has a couple spots to charge EVs while traveling to location.
Two Tesla specific chargers and three other EV chargers. Speed 40 miles per charging hour. Two of the 5 were ICE'd but it didn't matter so we didnt complain. Wish spaces were a little bit wider. It was tight squeeze. Hotel is nice. Elevators go from parking to room.
Two Tesla stations and one generic charger. $20 for non-Tesla users
"Two Tesla stations and one generic. The Tesla station is charging at a rate of 32 miles/hr on a Model Y. Nice people, but they raised the rate to $25 to use the charger if you are not staying there. It's $25 each time you plug in, so it's really not worth it unless you plan on leaving the car there for several hours. Availability seems good, even on a holiday weekend."
Two Tesla stations and regular charger at Quality Inn
Two were inoperable.
Two words- Buck and Ease!!!
Typical Tesla charging station. Next door to Applebee's. Lunch & restroom. Work well for me 😁
"Typically busy,  this is a popular one that I've used while shopping at Target,  but not super close, or while getting office work done at the Panera."
"Typically this charger is not busy, the proximity to the Hannaford's Grocery store is very convenient.  The Home Depot near by and the taco bell make the time spent charging easier to work through."
Ultra fast charging. Kind of remote but there's a subway and a dollar store behind it 🤷‍♂️
"Under construction! This is by far the weirdest charging station because of the obvious construction in progress. The charging bays are split up with a couple in obvious sight and accessible while the rest seem hidden within a change link fence, but you can get to them. I had to Dukes of Hazard, backward drive, to be able to access the last charging bay. This spot is definitely full coupled with an unusual Tesla charging set up because of the construction.  Didn't get out to go to Kroger's nearby, but several other drivers did. There's also a mosque not too far away, by drive."
Underused supercharger. Charges >1000miles/ hr. Next to Sheetz and Burger King and Wendy’s. I don test fast food but they are within 100 ft. Right off the highway.
"Unexpectedly busy, 9am on Friday, more than half the stations were used. I did not get anywhere close to 250 kw."
Unforgettful
"Unfortunately people don't clean after themselves here and leave their pizza box and pizza crust. There is a 🗑️ please take the extra steps to keep the world cleaner. If you wanted to purchase/lease an EV for environmental purposes, let's also clean up after ourselves. In addition, if the parking lot is full, it looks like a spot can be ICE'D"
"Units at this place don't work. There's no signage indicating a need to report to the front desk to pay. Got a loaner car from the dealership (Bradshaw is closed on weekends). New to the hunt for charging sources. Saw this place on the map, was told mistakenly that locations provide free charging.

Some crusty old guy came out and threatened to call the police for ""stealing power."" Excuse me some unidentified individual approaching me outside doesnt have the authority to do this."
"Unlike meijers, they have kept trash cans near the charging station. Really appreciate that."
"Unreliable, which is not acceptable for a charger. You have to go in to the library and ask them to turn on the charger. Employees may not know how. No charging after hours. There may be a number of hours limit that is below the number of hours needed for a full charge."
Unsure if it is supercharger or not. Can only get 300-350 miles/hours.
"Up against the service road before the entrance to Buc-ee's. As mentioned, a bit of a walk to the restrooms, but probably only twice the distance you'll walk inside the Buc-ee's store itself. Everything's bigger in Texas!"
"Update (March 2022) It appears some of the issues have been resolved. I am now seeing speeds up to 600mi/hr at 125kw. Hopefully this is the new standard for this station.

This station appears to be getting worse. Upon opening, chargers would max out at around 400 mi/hr. About a month later that was down to roughly 275 mi/hour. Now the best I have seen is 130 mi/hr at 40kw. Have tested multiple stalls each time, at varying levels of charge, with and without preconditioning the battery."
"Update 4/27/22: had to walk up the on-ramp just to get back inside the garage to return to my car because the doors are locked and the ticket readers at the doors don’t work. Also the pay station on the ground floor doesn’t work so you have to walk up the on-ramp to the 3rd floor pay stations to  pay. End result being I was charged for an extra hour because of the time I spent trying to get to my car (the “push for assistance button” also didn’t work and the office was empty). $4 for parking just to charge my Tesla on a slow charger and still pay the charging fees as well. Why can’t you rate as zero stars??

Original post: Parking garage is not open 24 hours and does not seem to even follow it’s own listed hours. I’ve arrived as early as 4 pm to find the gate already down. What a waste of time. Elon should definitely open one somewhere else in Oakland cause this is ridiculous."
"Update 7/5/2022: has now happened a third time. This is getting ridiculous.

Decent charging location EXCEPT that twice in the past few months the car suddenly stopped charging several minutes after connecting successfully. App said there was “no electricity.”  Never happens to me at any other supercharger."
"Update September 16th 2019: All supercharger are back in service.

September 12th 2019 Note: Only 3 chargers are operational. There is maintainance going on so you cant use others. Its high traffic Tesla chargers so be ready to wait for 30 minutes.

There are three restaurants nearby. Moes Grill Panera and Five Guys. Its close to freeway and easy to find."
"Update:
Ive gone twice. Restrooms were not as bad as the first time.
Pretty area. Restrooms and food at the Hotel nearby. Walked in and restrooms were on the other side. Out of 8 stalls 2 were only clean."
"UPDATE: 10/17 Ok. Location has gotten worse. Charge speed was 54kWh and one charger out of commission. You have to talk to the hotel for the bathroom and restaurant was closed until 5pm at the Hilton. Personally I’d avoid this place going forward on my trips from AZ to CA. Sorry but I’m not taking the 3:10 to Yuma anymore. 😉

Original Post:
This location was “ok”. Like many of the other reviews not the best “spot” with amenities, access to bathroom, food, etc… but I was a bit nervous about the charge rate and some people stated it was horrible. So I’m only charging at 1 unit, the last one on the left when facing the chargers unit 4B and it’s not that bad.  It’s giving me a good 110kW for about 450mil/hr. Not the best but not the worst. The location otherwise at 9pm is well lit and doesn’t seem unsafe. Good pit stop between Tucson and San Diego. 2 stars loss for lack of amenities."
"Update: window washing now available at trashcan near picnic tables. 1 ICE car in a stall with 3 telsa for the 6 spots and lot of other parking available, making it unnecessary for ICE car to be there.
------
Prepare to be ICEd here. 3 stalls blocked by 2 cars parking here when we arrived and a few others debated parking before moving on. Chargers are right outside the store, so it's highly desired parking  Stalls worked fine but didn't charge very quickly ~60kW max. Bathrooms were okay, at least had TP and running water unlike some stops, but could be cleaner. Nice outdoor area and convenience store has lots of snacks."
Updating my review. Don’t expect to get anywhere near the charging speed advertised. I’ve charged here a few times in the last few days and never get above 41kW charging speed. Even when I’m the only one at the chargers.
Urban (slower 70kw) supercharger. 12 available. Rarely busy. Bottom floor back wall.
"Use this charging station at your own risk. I parked my MS85D there late last night while visiting the bars and someone tried to steel my wheels. Because they could not remove the lug nuts, they stole all four of my wheel caps."
Use to charge here everyday when I was in college. Reliable as I could walk to Starbucks to study or go to Meijer for grocery run. 2 years ago I sold my Tesla and heard the huge price jump as back then was like .23c but recently I visited and someone told me .53c which I know it would have contributed me not getting a Tesla back in college days. Tesla needs to get pricing in order especially for ppl who cant charge at home
"Useable, plug is chewed up. If u carefully connect it to the cars port, it charges. Not dependable. EV charge is good with adapter at 6 Kw."
"Used 5/12/2022 about 5:30pm.  3 of 8 chargers in use when we arrived. Charged our M3 long range from 20% to 80% in only 19 minutes. Initial charge rate was 250kwh and an amazing 1000 miles / hour.

As others have said, there are no amenites here, just a convenience mart and gas station under construction.  Bathrooms are across the interstate on the other side of the exit where there is another (Valero) gas station and convience store.

4 stars due to lack of amenities at the moment, but it will be  5 star place once the convenience store opens."
Used few times. Great location.
Used it twice on my VW id4 works great pretty fast charging for a destination charger.
"Used on 6/23/2022 about 9am.  Arrived with 1 of 8 chargers in use. We filled our M3 long range from 44% to 70% in 10 minutes.  It is located on the NW side of Meijer.  Listed as 150KWH charger, and that appears to be correct."
"Used on 8/19/22 and got full 250kw charging speeds. Used it in the morning around 10am and I was the only one, then on the way back I stopped by at 7:30pm and there were two others charging. Overall, nice spot. Gas station inside was great and the bathrooms were clean. Definitely prefer this stop to the Nevada, MO Supercharger."
"Used the sideways post on the end, charged from 25% SOC to 80% SOC in 25 minutes. Enjoyed a fresh Made To Order Sheetz Italian sub. Yum!"
Used this charger a couple weeks ago.  Plenty of stalls and I maxed out at 261kW before dropping down to 170kW once my battery percent got higher. Plan to stop here again on future road trips!
"Used this supercharger on the way to Yosemite last week, works great and location has got beautiful river views and places to stay or dine around it…"
Used this to charge my iPhone in 2.7 seconds.  Docking one star because my phone blew up.
Used to be a faster charge. Now it’s 40 kW. Tesla please check this charging station.
"Used to be pretty packed, until they added more Superchargers (250kw) at Sheetz (just down the road) and Royal Farms (Urbana)."
Usually empty  never more than two others charging.  Frequently ICE cars do park in supercharger spaces while in Wawa
Usually has a spot open.
Usually has chargers available and it's quick off and on the highway.. This is one of my go-to charging locations.  Could use overhead shelter but I haven't seen that frequently at any chargers. Lots of decent food options and a short walk to Mejier.
Usually I come here to take a nap in the afternoon during a quick change. Starbucks is nearby for when I wake along with a great variety of other options. Lots of @$$holes in equinoxs like to come and park here though and just sit in there car... Good thing there's so many stations!
"Usually not busy. Connected and immediately went to 144 KW. Charging at 743 km after a minute

Subway Tim’s McDonald Petro can shell all very close. Two convenience stores very close as well. Near USA border.

The charging station is located Right near the trans canada highway"
"Usually not super busy, 8 bay super charger. Also has 4 electrify America chargers available for non tesla rigs as well as a couple blink chargers."
"Usually not super busy. Chargers are clean and it's conveniently located in a shopping center with a lot of stores. My wife and I often park then walk to Target, where she spends too much money on things we don't need."
Usually only about half full so no waiting. Sheetz is clean and has a nice area for eating or relaxing outside the vehicle. Easy access to highway so it’s a quick in and out stop.
Usually open spots in a convenient location. Not V3 chargers though.
"Usually packed, but I haven't had to wait for a stall yet. Right next to In&Out so pop over and get some food or a milkshake."
"Usually plenty of open charging stations, it's next to an outdoor outlet shopping center. One of the few locations that's not crowded."
"Usually pretty empty at nights but, conveniently right off 35. There's construction going on right now though, so, go slow. You can't make a left going west off 620 anymore"
Usually pretty quiet
Usually quiet because it’s obscured on the back side of Ridgewalk.
Usually spots available and working at full capacity. Next to grocery store and several restaurants. Good location in North Lake Tahoe.
Usually there's always someone there. Charge can go from 1hr to 4. Depends on vehicle and battery percentage. The place needs shade. There's only one spot under a tree that is always taken. Put more shade and it's perfect.
"V2 supercharger fired right up and kept me going down the road all the way to Manchester, CT."
V3 chargers right next to a Dunkin. Good experience.
V3 supercharger at Colorado Mills mall parking garage.  Saw a 155KW peak on my 2017 Model S and you don't have to worry about shared power between stalls at a v3 where every stall gets 250KW max.
V3 Supercharger location. I got 240kw peak during my charge. Right behind Culver’s close to interstate. Great fast easy stop with a place to grab a bite while you wait.
V3 supercharger right off the highway!
V3 supercharger right off the highway. We saw 1000 mi/hr! Also ICE drivers not respecting EV chargers.
V3 supercharger started right up and got me going quickly.  Great location with a coffee shop for morning charging and a local distillery and brewery for the evening.
V3 supercharger worked right away in group 2 and 3.  I wasn’t able to get a charge going in 1D and saw someone else move from 1C when it didn’t work for them.  It appears 8 of 12 are working.
"V3 supercharger, great place to stop if you're in the middle of Iowa and need some snacks or drinks from the Hy-Vee."
"V3 Supercharger, I got 249KW for about a minute and the overall charging speed was excellent.
The bathrooms are in the Big Y, on the right side of the store next to their food court. We picked up a cheesecake from their bakery which was very good"
V3 supercharger. Great place to stop by if you're traveling through southern Illinois
"V3 supercharger. If your Tesla is capable, you can get up to 1,000 miles/hour charging speeds!"
"V3 supercharger. Other reviewer probably had a high state of charge, hence his low charging speed. I managed to get 247 kW at around 22% battery."
"V3 Superchargers are tucked away in the back of Harris Teeter's side parking lot.  Easy walk to bathrooms in Harris Teeter.  Model 3 Long Range Peaked at 246 kW or 1006 mi/hr starting from low SOC!
Tip if you are traveling here via 895 N, the route Google takes you via Exit 10 is not great, Holabird Ave and Ponca St is meant for industrial traffic, watch for pot holes, craters, and canyons. Take Exit 11A instead."
V3 Superchargers right off of Route 3.  There is a Duncan Donuts and a Mac & Cheese place next to the chargers. DDs always have nice bathrooms.
V3 supper charger😱😱 in my model 3 SP I was getting 140kw.
"Valet access only, $7 just to get there.  This information is not signed at the street or elsewhere.  Pretty useless and deceptive.  Should be listed as destination charging."
Valet parking only. No instructions on how to get to supercharger. Not recommended for a quick stop. Go here only if you have one whole hour to spare.
Valets said charging is for restaurant customers only
Vallejo supercharger was crackin today! Charge was good too. Tent city across the street. It all made the pot fumes wafting over from the gal charging next to me seem quaint.
"Vandalism or not⁉️ Upon our arrival, the first thing we noticed was that most of the plugs were off their cradles/hooks and on the ground!  There were 3 chargers marked with an X done with duct tape!  Not sure if this a form of vandalism or not!  I’d like to think that the people whom purchase Tesla cars would not be doing this!  Made sure to place the chargers in their respective cradles but one of them was broken and would not stay hooked!"
"Variety of fast food restaurants nearby, grocery store across the parking lot, hospital across the street. Very walkable location. Trash cans on sight. 10/10. This will definitely be a routine stop for me when I'm in South Alabama.  This charger was much-needed!"
"Verizon cellular service is almost unuseable here. The charger slowed and slowed and dropped down below 60KW. The timer suddenly reset and wanted me to wait another 15 minutes.

Easy to find and well lit. Steps away from a Wawa... But I don't get the hype around Wawa. Royal Farms seems way better."
"Version 2 supercharger by a car wash, bakery and farmers market. There is also a 24 hour laundromat where you can use a clean bathroom. Pretty views."
Version 3 superchargers conveniently located next to a Giant Eagle supermarket and a Target and other stores and restaurants nearby.
Version 3 Tesla Supercharger with 250kW charging for all stalls. Not an easy location to find so follow your navigation carefully. Clean location with food nearby.
Very basic charger setup with no amenities on its own. The nearby grill is a good place for a bite to eat and a bathroom break while waiting. We got quick service for lunch on the weekend.
"Very busy and 2  chargers were out of order so I had to wait, along with many others,  which could have been avoided"
very busy and charging slow despite being at low charging state
"VERY busy charger at green QuikChek gas station that can be confusing to get to, esp if you use Tesla’s GPS. Only one space available on a Sunday at 6pm. Pretty fast though if you can snag a space."
"Very busy charger in a Saturday afternoon. Unless you’re here for the mall, I’d find one a little more out of the way if possible."
Very busy charger. At the side of a Wawa gas station.
Very busy charger. I think 8 spots. Just a Meijer in the parking lot. They need trashcans out here.
"Very busy location, 5 stars for shopping and food but 4 stars for ease to get to it and access."
Very busy on a Friday afternoon. Walk to Starbucks and Mackenzie River Pizza Co. Behind Starbucks in Best Western Plus parking lot.
"Very busy on a Tuesday (10am), and not very fast. Does have HyVee supermarket next to it which is convenient."
Very busy parking lot. Wouldn’t come at night
Very busy place. One stall iced for a while. The Wawa will be closing for construction don't remember the dates.
Very busy Supercharger at a good location.
Very busy Supercharger at a good location.
"Very busy supercharging spot, 2 chargers are still out of service as of Nov 2022. Would highly recommend Samurai Sushi - delicious and they made our sushi rolls very quickly."
Very busy when I visited. Still fast charging. Located in a convenience store parking lot which is great.
"Very busy with no way of knowing who's in line, with cars parked everywhere. TESLA should make some type of que system. Two chargers kept giving errors. Had to keep switching spots and its busy... Nightmare."
"Very busy, but the only Supercharger in town. The app reported it was closed, but there are only a couple being serviced by Tesla while we are charging. 10 minutes to Starbucks so easy walk while you charge."
"Very busy, need few more super chargers. Only has 4 chargers. 5 minutes walk and cross the road there are some restaurants."
"Very busy. As I charge, three cars waiting to connect (on a random Thursday 2 pm), also means charging speed reduced to 50 kW."
Very busy. Picked the most expensive time to charge (not by choice) . It's at the outlet mall so lots of traffic and shared charging stalls. The stall I had to use was in need of repairs both on the unit and the charging handle.
Very clean &quiet!! Good price. Would recommend
Very clean and convenient super charger located right behind a Sheetz.
"Very clean and plenty of chargers. Best part is that its in a Wawa parking lot with friendly staff, clean restrooms, and tons of snacks"
"Very clean and safe place in front of the hilton. 3 functional chargers. The strange thing is they are directly in front of the valet stand so I only left the car on charge for a little while because the area said no parking, and then I moved to a regular spot."
"Very clean gas station, good food/drink/snack options and friendly staff.  Grassy area behind the chargers to walk your dogs.

One minor issue - navigation indicates the chargers are on the wrong side of the road."
"Very clean new and super fast
Don't miss this stop, good food in super gas station and lots of shopping to keep.you busy."
"Very clean, easy in and out!  Love filling up my Model 3."
"Very close to exit/on ramps. Near circle K for coffee and restroom. Other fast food choices nearby. 12 slots as advertised, working very well."
"Very close to Highway 101, restaurant & lodging too. I was getting 137 kw. starting from a 27% charge. Got enough juice in  10 to 12 minutes to complete my remaining 116mile trip. Turn over at charging stations was quick."
Very close to highway and fast charging
Very close to mall.
"Very close to my hotel.
All wawa's should have at least 8 superchargers like this one.
Not expected speed but good enough."
"Very close to my location, but I don't want to pay for $2 as an extra fee. I would consider if this was upgraded to 250kWh. Now I go to 5795 Christie Ave for 7 minutes of extra driving."
"Very convenient , no wait...."
"Very convenient & plenty of spots.

I'm thinking 20 spots, way more than Menlo Mall area.

Cigar Bar right behind the charging station.
Starbucks/ Barnes & Noble across the street,  as well as the mall itself of you're looking to do some shopping or food court.

Bar Louie right there for a drink and I belive another Burger/ Beer joint is opening up September 2022.

UPDATE 2/23: The bar is no longer called Bar Louie and the burger place has opened"
Very convenient chargers. One of the best locations with lots of food options on the same plaza. We stopped on the way to the beach and from the beach. Got to eat at Panera Bread by the chargers.
"Very convenient charging location before entering Acadia national park. You have to look for it a bit but its located behind the grocery store , Hannaford and next to the bottle redemption center. It was empty while we visited on Sunday afternoon and be ready for other folks to park in spots that clearly are marked for Tesla only"
"Very convenient charging spot near Yosemite's south entrance. While you wait, check out the Hotel Lobby, beautiful place."
Very convenient charging station.  Actual kWh advertised did not reach while charging.  After about 80% charge it reduced to about 42 kwh.  Do not know why?
"Very convenient close to the interstate. The gas station has a nice clothing/ boots store in it!

👢 👖  🤠"
Very convenient for shopping or dining while charging
Very convenient in the highway 40 and NC 42. A lot restaurant around
Very convenient located next to the ferry. Across the street from a good restaurant.
"Very convenient location  , right next to the highway  in rest area , 8 stals total, 2 pull up one's. Coffee,  food and bathrooms  all here :D"
"Very convenient location in woodclif lake
8 charging slots which is great.

Busy during evening but morning are open

Many stores nearby so wait is not an issue"
"Very convenient location just off I-70. Part of a large, growing network of the fastest EV chargers in the U.S. Can go anywhere desired in the U.S. using this charger network, which continues to expand quarterly and shorten routes across states."
Very convenient location right off the highway in downtown Corvallis! Great place to charge while staying for a game or visiting town!
Very convenient location to charge. Much needed in this area. Burger King is in walking distance.
"Very convenient location with food and carwash at Sheetz. We were the only car charging on multiple visits.

Getting back on the highway was pretty simple, though you may have to make a u-turn."
"Very convenient location, normal  convenience store (Hy-Vee) across the street to the west ( snakes, roller grill,  caribou coffee and  free air). Hy-Vee Grocery store to the east which has a a great set down cafe or salad bar, and Grand buffet that includes  Chinese, Italian, and American selections.  Chill's Bar and Grill just north west of the chargers.... Plus a Starbucks in Hy-Vee and then a stand alone store within walking distance"
"Very convenient location, Target, CVS nearby. Right next to Panera bread. Total of 12 stalls available."
Very convenient next to Wawa
"Very convenient place to charge. We got everything we need while changing. Groceries, restaurants, electronics ect. This is my favorite place to charge."
"Very convenient supercharger, getting 68 kW during the last 5 min of our charging. Near a Meijer with very clean restrooms. Also has a Hamptons and a Country Inn & Suites at this location."
"Very convenient to use, even when towing a trailer. Large parking lot and pull in charger making it easy to charge while towing a trailer."
"Very convenient,  right off RT9 plenty of spaces.  Shop while you charge your vehicle"
"Very convenient, when available. When lot is full, non tesla cars will park there."
Very convenient.
"Very convenient.

Charged few weeks ago.

At far end of rest area. Straight Past gas station.

Has trailer pull in charger."
"Very convenient. 240kw so by the time my wife went into the CVS, use the restroom,  and bought some lip balm, my car was fully charged"
Very conveniently located just off of I-95 on Powerline Rd. and W. Cypress Creek Rd. It is right in Wawa Gas Station and all a busy area. You feel safe to charge all day and night. There are 8 stations and always busy.
"Very conveniently located near INDIANAPOLIS business center however it's not free. It costs $5 for 45 minutes of parking. Charging is free but in order to charge you need to park.
This parking lot can be used if you want to visit Circle Centre Mall ,some great restaurants , even concert or sporting events
Hyatt and Westin hotels are just few steps away. Eagle nest rooftop restaurant is less than 400 ft away. There are many great places around here. Famous sports stadiums are close by too.
This is 12 stall station so you will always find a spot. Besides charging , you can also park here at cheaper rate if you are driving Tesla.It's very popular location so many people struggle to find parking around here but if you are driving Tesla you got yourself a great incentive.
Restroom are available ONLY to TESLA owners and passengers. Its very clean and convenient located opposite elevators near Ticket payment machine. You will find code to unlock it in Tesla navigation app.
Note: This urban supercharger so charging speed will not match full size Supercharger. Speed will vary from 200miles/hour to 310 miles/hour.
Model 3 charges faster than S and S charges faster than X."
Very crowded since close to food court entrance. Multiple lines on parking spots which seems to be causing several drivers to struggle to park. Most spots full during this visit. Bathrooms in food court were only 2 unisex rooms and didn't seem clean.
"Very crowded, low & slow charge rate (started at 18 kWh, got to ~55 max). Not walkable to anything, except an adjacent Tesla gallery, which only has the insta coffee (no snacks or anything). The staff there are also not attentive to problems, such as cars parked in Supercharger spots that aren't charging!"
"Very difficult to locate. Near a fantastic restaurant, 34 Degree North in Beaufort NC"
"VERY disappointed that there were 6 free Tesla chargers here (company installs for free) but no where to charge an electric vehicle such as a Prius.  Even an outdoor 110 plug would suffice.  Sort of a ""Common Man ""  themed rest area but it does need a charge point for electric cars other than Tesla whose charger fits NO OTHER vehicle."
"Very disappointed.  We’ve utilized this location multiple times with good results.  Today, after a long haul from Las Cruces, NM, we rolled in near empty on charge.  We hopped out to use the Hampton Inn restrooms as we’ve always done only to be confronted by an employee who said we could not use the restrooms and hung a sign stating they were “not available”.  No amount of discussion with four different Tesla drivers would deter him from his position.  Why would a business who agreed to this charging point and who allows advertisement of public restrooms allow this?"
"Very easy access from the highway, but as far as super chargers go, this one needs some work. The lot is not paved, and at the time we visited had some bumps and potholes right near the entrance to the lot. These are avoidable, so just keep a lookout. The other challenge is that there isn't much around, so you pretty much only have the little cafe that this parking lot belongs too. We chose to simply charge enough here and then move on to the next charger for our meal."
"Very easy to access off of the Garden State Expressway. Acme has food options, bathrooms, and about 15 minutes from Cape May"
"Very easy to access, clean facilities to take a break while charging."
"Very easy to find in the parking lot behind directly behind the Hilton Garden inn / Courtyard Hotel right off of I-90. This is a perfect place to stop for the night on that long Jorney when you want to have a Fresh charge when you wake up in the AM! The exit also has a cracker barel and various fast food and convince stops. The hotel is large enough to be staffed 24hrs in case you or the kids need a place place where you can use the facilities if you're just passing through.

CAME BACK  through a week later had to down grade my review from 5 stars. Here's why, Snow removal is Key in the frozen north when you have a 4' cord on a supercharger so either make sure your people clear the snow enough to plug in the $100,000 car so I can continue on my Jorney with wading Knee deep in snow or at least put a 12' cord on the charger so I don't have to beach said vehicle on a snow bank just to hook it up to the gogo juice! To add insult to injury This seems to be an ongoing problem the #4 charger plug is damaged enough not to work. Probbly from somone not willing to back up enough to plug it in properly in sub zero temperatures  this is Eire Pensyltucky not like it dosn't snow more months a year than it's sunny, for the Californians that designed the supercharger stations. Begs the question Elon Musk, you've upgraded the cars, many times so if you're interested in what costomers think how about bringing supercharger stations forward with those cars. Oh and feel free to give me call for some much needed non billionaire  perspective."
"Very easy to get in and out of the superchargers. Grocery store has extensive solar panels, so this is very ""Green"" charging :) Inside the store they have a nice café and ready-made food, and clean bathrooms. I definitely think this is one of the better super charging stops"
Very easy to see when driving up to it at a Casey's gas station. Can quickly grab food/drink while waiting to charge (during business hours).
Very fast
Very fast
Very fast
"Very fast 250 charging station, almost 40 units. Some aren't in use (covered), and the faster ones have an individual charging box. There's eigjt regular 250 units. The others must be a higher level because we fully charged within an hour and needed over 200 units."
"Very fast at around 500 miles of range an hour. The Starbucks next door is very busy, usually slower to get your drinks. As you'll be here around 30 minutes anyways, I wasn't in a rush to get my green tea very quickly. Weird Starbucks interior, but it works. Nice outdoor sitting area. There's other places nearby, but I like to be able to watch the supercharger area as there's a busy ATM right next to it and homeless people looking for handouts in the middle of the day."
Very fast charge!
Very fast charger. Plan ahead because this one doesn't have any food or drinks nearby.
"Very fast charger. Right off the highway. By Sheetz gas station so good restroom, food stop. Walmart is about a 10 min walk down a huge hill so if ya need something quick. Definitely just gonna drive there after charge though haha. You get some cool mountain air here too. Outdoor seating currently closed due to covid which is too bad"
Very fast charging
Very fast charging and a convenient location next to a Costco and in the lot of a Sheetz convenience store/gas station.
Very fast new charger with a nice service station next door. Clean bathrooms and windshield washers are in good shape.
"Very fast Supercharger, right behind a Wendy's and a convenience store that carries a better variety of snacks and different canned coffees than any other place. They also have trash, recycling, windshield sponges and towels right by the chargers."
"Very fast Tesla charging, no adaptor needed.  Very busy with a wait, but fast turnover since it's fast charging. Automatically stops charging at 80% due to high demand."
Very fast with great convience around the station
"Very fast, plenty of stalls and all kinds of retail businesses very close."
Very fast! Located in the far side of the service plaza (when exiting Northbound). There are about 8 stalls in total.
Very fast! No wait.
Very fast. Lots of stalls and no one was there on a Tuesday during the day. Walking distance to food and coffee.
Very friendly place to stop for the night!!! Would recommend!
"Very friendly staff, perfect place to park and charge while you shop for groceries.
Also, great neighborhood to take a stroll through!"
Very good charging speeds.  This stop is right off the exit ramp just take a quick left and then right.  Dogs will enjoy the fenced Dog Park right by the chargers.  There is a Denny’s connected to the gas station if you want to grab a bite.
"Very good charging station with convenient restrooms, food, drinks, and outside walking area with pond…I find the Buc’ee charging stations very good, just takes a lot of driving through parking areas and dodging pickup trucks.   At this store, the charging is in the furthest back corner on North end.  Stay on entrance road past the store and take last left into parking and straight back.  Apparently there are alligators in the pond."
"Very good here. Highly recommend!!!
Must stop supercharger sports!!! Nice cafe but not 24h open. But nice place and fast 250kw. Thanks"
Very good location next to Texas Roadhouse and Red lobster along with the Rapid City mall. 150 kW for chargers.
Very good. Need more of them.
"Very great decoration in front of the hotel, surprised no dust has collected since it hasn't been touched in years."
Very handy and easy for a Level 2 charger
"Very handy, large grocery store, gas station, Tesla charging stations, easy access to I-80. Good stopping place. Soon there should be a fast food place. There is a deli and beer cafe in the store. Also a liquor store and medical clinic in the same building."
Very handy. Easy shopping while charging. Lots of shops to choose from.
Very happy to have a Tesla Supercharger near Fort Smith.  It is the only one in the area.  Next closest one is exit 35 in Ozark or exit 78 in Lowel off I49 near Fayetteville.   Might as well grab some pizza at Casey's while you wait.
Very hard to find but supercharging exists! Entered garage through West Alabama (small entrance right after Banana Republic door) and you have to go down a level to LL2 to get to the superchargers since LL1 only has demo
"Very inconsistent charging, sometimes it’s a 250kw charger, but sometimes I’m here all by myself and I’m lucky to get 150kw. I will start driving the another Tesla charger where they have consistent charging."
"Very little at this supercharger besides a very tired strip mall. Be warned, the bathrooms at Roses are disgusting and the only food is a Dunkin and a Chinese place.  Stop somewhere else first for food and bathrooms"
Very long wait because of rental cars being charged by employees.
"Very much enjoyed the close proximity to The Sunridge: a restaurant, bar, and grill. It's great for family dining. I was able to eat, drink, and rest.

I was slightly disappointed there was not an attendant to plug my car in and pump my electricity for me. This is Oregon after all."
"Very much needed supercharger location in Manchester.

There are 16 supercharging stalls which is double the amount compared to West Hartford.

There is a Five Guys, Artisanal Burger company burger, and Noodles&Co nearby. In the same plaza you’ll find Jo Ann fabrics, Big Lots, Dollar Tree, Toys R Us, Party City, none of which are too useful for travelers.

Love that Tesla opened up a location east of Hartford but it really should have been near the buckland hills mall, had to knock off a star for that."
"Very new, lots of construction around."
Very nice
"Very nice 250kw charger, nice and safe and beautiful. Pulled in with 3% battery,  car ramped up to 253kw pretty much immediately charged for 20 minutes and kept it moving on my road trip."
Very nice and clean. Play area for kids to enjoy.
"Very nice brand new charger, as of 04-2021, the J1772 charger (6.6KW) is free for first 2 hrs which I thought was very nice of Tesla to include."
"Very nice cabins to stay overnight near Bryce and charge your Tesla overnight. 2 chargers are mounted on the north wall of the property near cabins 31, 32."
Very nice charging area! Gotta love having it close to the Meijer. This charging station has been one of the fastest that I've been to and its also very well kept. Overall I'd say its a top tier which means I give it a 10/10
"Very nice charging station in a Target parking lot. Includes pull in charger. Well lit in a safe area.
Starbucks across the street.
Restaurants within walking distance: Steak ‘n Shake, Crumbl Cookie, and Subway."
Very nice charging station with fast charge. Convenient location near restaurants. Sits behind Smithfield's which has great service and food as well as clean bathrooms. Nice greenbelt area for walking dogs or letting the kids run around.
Very nice clean 🧽 pleas next to target  🎯
Very nice easily accessible station.
"Very nice EV charging complex located adjacent to a Fred Meyer.  In addition to Tesla, there are Electrify America CCS1 combo chargers with CHAdeMO, and Blink J 1772 level 2 chargers. Oh yeah, there's a gas station across the parking lot as well.

As usual, the Tesla chargers performed superbly."
"Very nice location, but they have no trash can nearby the chargers."
"Very nice location. Great bathrooms at the nearby visitor center. Lots of nearby restaurants. Viewing area for the river, including a trail that you can walk along the river. You might even see base jumpers jump off the bridge.  If it had $250 KW it would be even better."
"Very nice location. We went to a Mexican place nearby to eat and by the time we ordered the food, Car was ready to go again. Good food options and upscale area to be in if arriving after dark."
Very nice people at location. Though this is not a supercharger.
Very nice place to juice up...there are 4 Tesla’s and 2 stage two chargers ...none require any form of ID or card ...there are no signs as of 2018 to protect them from ice parking...so you may need to get creative. These are cars that were displayed at 2018 drive electric car show ...next one will be in Kaukauna in September 2019.
"Very nice place to stop by for charging - it has total of 8 Tesla connectors with max 250KWH power delivery (V3 super charger) for charging very quickly. It has multiple options for food like Pizza hut, Iowa 80 Kitchen, Dairy queen, Wendy's and for coffee lovers, there is a caribou coffee shop . Also the charging station is right next to the I80 truck museum- really worth visiting who likes or interested in knowing about the trucks. This place also has the charge point company connectors available for non Tesla electric vehicles."
Very nice place to stop to get a charge. It’s one of the last stops coming from the bay area and going to the casino in Jackson. We actually didn’t charge all the way and still made it back to charge up to get back to the bay area. I hope they get the supercharger in that area because it’s still a little nerve wrecking!  But if you come during the day there is a bass pro shop a big mall and bathrooms to go to. They have security as well. If you come at night everything is and was closed for us but we are used to most things being closed when I supercharge at night. I still felt safe especially because I had the men with me and my mini!  Not sure how I feel I was alone but it’s very open plenty of time to observe and prepare. I will come here again.
"Very nice set up for both Tesla’s and other electric destination with Tesla Gen 3  40miles per hour charging,  but you need to call ahead and ask that a space be reserved for you because the spaces are the nearest non handicapped parking and others without EVs will take them just to avoid walking further - especially in bad weather!  The night i was there every one of 8 spaces except one was taken with pickups and folks to lazy to walk...it was scary but fortunately I got the last space with 14 miles of charge left on the battery...there is a supercharging station 4 miles to the West but that wound have cost me time in the morning...just saying!"
"Very nice, accommodating stop.  Ice cold water in the lobby, clean restroom, and a comfortable lobby. 8 charging stalls."
"Very nice, clean supercharger. Convenient amenities, including a bowling alley!! Might be fun to play a game or two while charging! There are several restaurants within walking distance, especially across the street. Many convenient hotels as well. Very nice and safe area. Will definitely be back to this one!"
Very nice.
Very nice.  Close to lots of shops and restaurants.
Very nice. Campground and store. If you have the option fast charge is available.
Very overpriced and too slow to be 250 kW.  Avoid this location if you want to save time and money.
"Very poorly kept charging station. The only thing that worked was the Tesla charger. Everything else was broken! Charging plugs are just lying on the floor and look like they’ve been run over multiple times

And I needed an adapter for it. Thank God I had it. What a mess"
Very productive .super chargers do great job .was at about 18 fully charged and gone just under an hour including calibration..
Very quick charging 15 minutes area was very clean
"Very quiet area, but it's a short walk to a grocery and other businesses. At most, four stalls were in use during my charging."
Very Quiet location next to Stop & Shop and it works!
"Very quiet place and covered.
There are four stall on the right and eight on the left. Across from Mom’s organic market, covered station and not busy at all.
You can stop by for charge and check our the market and use the bathroom if needed at market."
Very safe area. Not too busy.  Located in the parking lot of Bizzy Bees gas station.  It is like a mini Buc-ees.
Very sketchy. I would only stop in the middle of the day. There are no restrooms.
"Very slow charger, barely hitting 200mi/hr.
At least you can do your grocery shopping at the Winn-Dixie next door, with plenty of time to spare. Probably better off choosing another charging station."
Very slow charging
Very slow charging for a public location.  It seemed like a 240v home charging location at ~ 3 miles/hour rate on my Model 3 Twin Motor Long Range.
Very slow charging. I’m the only car here and the rate of charge has steadily dropped from the 50s to the 30s kW. Seems like something is wrong.
Very slow charging. Max 70 kw (293 mi/hr). Great to walk around but it’s not worth the wait.
Very slow compared to what it should be
"Very slow supercharger. Tesla says it can charge up to max 150 kwh but while we were charging barely hit 75. Station wasn't full either, only four other stalls in use."
Very slow. Tesla charger in the back parking lot was engaged and sitting fully charged.
Very slow.. 30% to 90% took over an hour. 250mi/hr is average charge rate.
Very spacious area with Walmart and Sonic nearby.
"Very UN-friendly location to pedestrians, so super annoying for a lunchtime stop. All restaurant options are across multi lane highways with no pedestrian signals or sidewalks. Charger itself was fine and convenient."
"Very useful new addition to charging options on I-81. Am now able to charge just once between Raleigh NC and West of Knoxville TN (Model 3 long range RWD). Charged from 15-90% in around 30 minutes.  Restroom facilities are available in the Comfort Inn. Not much in the immediate vicinity for food options, but If coming northbound Marion (about 4-5 miles away) has quite a few options for you to take to the charger. Worked out good for us."
Very very nice place to go for a EV charging!!! Places to eat around there.
Very very nice to have this supercharger in the area. It would really be nice if there was more EV chargers in the area.
"Very well hidden. Navigate to H&M or Levi's at the outlet mall. 4A station broken...bent pin...vandalism? Area littered, somewhat isolated unless outlet mall open. Little Rock needs more and better."
Very well lit plenty of places to browse and eat while you recharge
Very well lit up but I was there at 5AM and didn’t love getting out to check the area out. It’s behind huge buildings rather than in front of store fronts you could see...
"Very, very friendly.  I was in a jam and they helped me with a charge, free, no problem. I had miscalculated the higher speed of Idaho highways and so here I am about 10 miles short of confidently moving on down the road. My 4 rating is due the slow speed but really this was great help yet. I just don't to mislead anyone that it was a high-speed charge. It is confounding that Twin Falls should not have a high speed charging center for others besides Tesla."
"Very, very nice to have one in Auburn near the mall. Usually there's one or two other cars. Sometime there are no others. I go every couple of weeks."
"Very, very, Slow 31 mph hour charge.  Avoid if possible."
"Victorville needed a supercharger installation desperately.   coming from vegas, barstow to Santa clarita was stressful and we were always concerned about charg levels.  now it's a quickie @ victorville and easy ride to Santa clarita .  lousy install design and no amenities...but a bump charge in and out."
"Visited 12/24/22 only 4 of the 8 stations were working. Otherwise, it is a great location only a few minutes from the freeway with a few different food options."
Visited at night and felt safe under the bright lights in the hotel parking lot adjacent to the lobby. The hotel bathrooms are decent. I didn't make it to TA so can't comment on that. Charging is pretty solid at 120ish kW. There's an open field behind the chargers for pets to walk and do their business. Cell reception (att) is decent at 5g with 2 bars.
Visited this supercharger twice while in town.Not great- one broken charger and terribly slow charge speeds. The nav said it was 150kw and we barely got 70kw speeds. Visited mid afternoon one day and late at night on another. The area was clean and adjacent to a Starbucks and a couple casual restaurants.
Wait time with three cars in front of us was 50 minutes. The speed is too slow and took us close to an hour to charge to 75%. The queue now is 10 Tesla cars and I can’t imagine how long they will have to wait. Not driving through this supercharger anymore
"Waited 10 minutes for a space to open up. While I was charging, an employee went to get something from her gas powered car that was parked in the handicapped charging spot."
Waited 30 min in line to get charged.  Don’t go here at peak hours 4-6 pm
waited over an hour to get my tessy charged 🤦🏽‍♂️
"Walk into Hampton Inn to use the very clean restrooms. Staff are pleasant and didn’t say anything; we didn’t ask permission. Chargers were fast enough, but there’s not much in the immediate near area in terms of food- shops."
"Walked down First Street, found places to get a tattoo, piercing, hooka, and cannabis but no restroom or place to get a beverage or food. Parking is free for entering to access charging, as it should be! Parking is free at other Tesla Supercharger locations."
"Walking distance of a mall,tacobell, and dairy queen.

Sometime clean, and also sometimes messy.

Barley ever busy so that's a plus."
Wall Charger unit.  I didn’t use this one specific unit yet but the one on the same property that I did use was hooked on a 120 line so it will only charge 5 miles per hour of charge.  The other charger next to it charges faster and requires the adapter for a Tesla.
WARNING:  avoid charger 2C because it only gives 36 kW!  The others work well.  Located at a truck stop/gas station right off the high way.  Decent selection of food and snacks inside.
"WARNING!!!! TOLL TRAP!!! There is a supercharger in the town of Somerset that you can use if you're trying to avoid tolls (1030 N Ctr Ave, Somerset, PA 15501). It's just 2 miles from this one. I was close to it, but the car forced me to get on the Turnpike and navigated me to this one instead, even though avoid tolls was selected for my trip!"
Was a great place to stop as it was in middle of my trip.  Fast charge and plenty of spots.
Was a little hard to find at first- right behind the Great American Cookie store…fast and not busy
Was able to charge about 38 miles per hour at this charger. Hotel and restaurant staff are fantastic! Do yourself a favor and have lunch or dinner at the Timbers restaurant! It's good food and great service!
Was able to charge fairly quickly and I believe this store is around
Was able to use this for 3-4 hours of charging my Tesla today (38 miles an hour). The second charger seems to be for other generic EV. We did not stay at this hotel so just the fact that it is available is a pretty big plus for travelers already. Knocked off one star since the connector for the Tesla seems to be coming loose (some taping was done) let's hope it won't get further damaged and fixed at some point.
Was awesome! Nice little town way out on 60 and free charging for my model s! Plugged in and went and had lunch and charged up for going through the mountains. Was supposed to be 4 units but was only one installed but still worked great!
"Was busy, so I didn't get the full charge speed. It was also hard pull into to the stalls the way the parking lot was arranged"
Was charging up to 45miles/hr. Worked great especially since there are no other chargers in a 25 mile radius.
"Was getting gas and these charging stations s were available at Sheetz. I my first lesson on Tesla vehicles and charging stations. I can see Tesla in my near future, I'm getting in line for mine.
Update: This Sheetz Staion is under demolition, not sure if another one is being built on site. Surely will be missed😒😪🤒🤕"
"Was going into ensenada for the first time in my tesla 3 so I decided to charge up and check out the hotel. Location is excellent as hotel is right off the highway, the guy at the hotel gate didn’t even ask if I had reservation, lol, he said buenos dias and activated up the arm to get in, pretty sure they just know we’re charging!
Now the thing that sucks is the ramp up to get to the chargers, it’s super steep so the bumper touched a bit and at the top even going sideways It touched the bottom of the car. Just be careful and go slow and see which side is less steep.
Fast chargers!"
Was good for first 15 min@. (100-120kw— though way shy of the 250kw listed). Then dropped to 5kw.   Should have snapped a pic to report to Tesla.  Wasn’t sure if it was our car or the chargers.  Reading the reviews I am sure it’s the chargers.  Please report it if you stop by
Was good got us the range we needed to get to a DC charger. It is in a State Park so had to pay $9 to get in since we are from out of state.
"Was good once we got a station there was quite a bit of wait, and the first station we parked into wasn't working."
Was good. I had to stop late at night and it worked perfectly. Quick 10 minutes at full power made me a happy guy. There's lots of food and shopping close by if you're there during business hours. Even in the middle of the night it was well lit and easy to access.  If I'm nearby I'd definitely stop there again.
Was hard to find at first. On top floor at back of parking lot
"Was here yesterday, Charger not working, don't waste your time."
Was just there  charger was quick and worked  well
"Was not busy at all, a little hard to find all the way behind the outlet mall, but there were trash cans available and restrooms in the outlet mall.  Charge speeds up to 771 mi/hr on my Model 3, yay!  Added about 110 miles for under $10."
Was not operational
Was pretty busy but it’s the shopping season. Only place to eat nearby is the sports bar and a Winn Dixie. I’ve been there a few times and never had to wait.
"Was so surprised to see the 12 Tesla Superchargers behind the Dollar Store. I have no need for one, but someone may be looking for a place to charge up. I'm glad to help."
"Was thankful to find this charger close to Fort Sam, wasnt aware of these chargers on that side of town. I previously had to use the chargers at a nearby hotel that took hours to charge back up."
Was the only one charging midday on a weekday. Charging at 150kw  so it was very fast. Very close to a large grocery store for restroom and snacks. A few miles away from highway 55 so a bit of a detour but not bad.
"Was there on Saturday morning, around 7am. There were two Model X and I was there to charge my Model 3 SR+. Charger was fast, at least for me. Stopped at McDonald across the street. Overall, was good."
"was there this morning with very good view before sunrise
this charging station rate is one of the cheapest nearby"
Was very busy when we were there.bit got in and charged and enjoyed some outdoor Sheetz snacks.
Was very excited to learn that my car could charge as I enjoyed the amenities of the Borgata.
Was very quiet with nice combination of Tesla and J1772 level 2 chargers.  Free charging and plenty of spaces.
Was worried about slow speed charging from some of the recent reviews but I got 120kw starting at 30% so it's working good now for stall 1B at least.
"Wasn't as quick to charge as other locations I've been to, even with just a few cars charging at once."
Wasn’t peak time but was a little more expensive for a 72 kw hour charger I wish they would upgrade These being so close to the airport
Wasn’t there to charge a vehicle but to meet someone instead as it was highly visible from the access road. Quite a few spots to charge vehicles. Easy to get in and out of parking area and had easy access from the access road right off the highway.
wasted space for junk golf carts
Wasted stop. Decent location but all of the stations are slow AF with no one else here at all charging. 3B not charging at all. Topped out at 30kw on all other stations we tried.
"Watch for pud holes every where going towards charging station. No restroom period ! for customer who's buying food in grocery store towards to Al's oasis. That's ridiculous!
Free restroom inside Gas station convenient store."
"Wawa lets you order from your car with these spot number by your Tesla charger. There are 8 spot, if you’re coming from the entrance between Wawa and Starbucks. Make sure to start at the second spot. The first spot doesn’t have a Tesla charger. Spot 48. Additionally be careful when backing in cars that are going to get gas 10 to come in the parking lot fast. There is a Starbucks and McDonalds close too."
"Way better supercharger than tannersville nearby, easy in and out from Rt 80 and Rt 33. usually not busy and it's higher power too. (250kw) note: the tesla directions in the car nav are always wrong and you should just take whatever exit for 611N and then turn left into giant plaza."
Way to go Holiday Inn Express with another Tesla Supercharger setup. We were able to pull in to charge and did not have to drop our trailer. If you needed to drop your trailer to charge there is room.
"Way to many transit people standing around walking up to cars asking for money.
Other than that it's not to bad of a spot to super charge ya car."
We are a guest at the Heritage Inn. It is great to have access to this Tesla charger. We get a full 48 amp charge. We love visiting the Heritage Inn because we have Teslas as well that we enjoy the trip to Snowflake. Thank you very much.
"We are forced to use this supercharger regularly, and it regularly cuts output from >120kW to "
"We are new Tesla drivers that being said...finding the physical stations once you get to the location is like playing  ""Hide and Seek"" or ""Marco Polo"". When I say in completely random places is an understatement. Tesla does a great job at keeping you informed regarding your trip range and how much juice you'll once you get to your location; they need to do better with identifying locators (i.e. 2nd level parking structure, next to Wendy's, in the WAWA parking lot etc)"
We arrived here super late. It’s tucked behind the Wendy’s in the corner. Nothing is opened 24hours besides the marathon gas station across the road which have clean restrooms. Overall ok just wish something was open closer foe restrooms
"We arrived on a Sunday afternoon to charge on our way thru to Kansas City and only one stall open as all other stalls occupied by ICE cars! We were the lucky ones. Two teslas turned away in frustration and third waited 20 plus minutes for ice car owner to leave dog park!!! Bar K only rents space nearby, yet their customers consume charging stations as if they are parking spots. No other amenities not even restrooms! Worst super charger experience in two years of ownership and btw we were traveling with 2 dogs!! Tesla why this location as no one has any incentive  to monitor or step in to ask ice owners to not park in charging spots?  where’s the oversight/solution?"
We called ahead and ordered Olive Garden takeout and enjoyed in our car while charging. It’s in the parking lot of a very nice Olive Garden with some small green space for dogs. Charging was fast and there were many other options for food nearby.
"We came here about 0230 in the morning, so everything was closed, but close enough to stores to go visit to pass time if they are open, but I felt safe enough to take a small nap while waiting for my car to charge. No issues with the chargers themselves. Thanks Telsa for the excellent supercharging network!"
"We came here for a break to stretch, use the bathroom and get food and buy snacks. This is nicely placed where we could fulfill everything we wanted before continuing our road trip. There were plenty of spots to charge and the supercharger truly charged the car fast to where it was ready just by the time we are ready to continue driving."
We charge here frequently.  The location is right in the center of the shopping plaza under some trees. It makes for an easy walk to the restrooms and the food court. Several of the shops give a discount if you show your fob. We have only ever experienced one negative and that was when the parking lot was bring redone about a year ago. They had the entrance closed and we had to drive around the back of the shops and enter thru an exit. Not a big deal once you know how to do this.
"We charge here frequently. The charger is located next to the Grizzly and Wolf discovery center. A great place to visit.
Only a few steps further is the IMAX with a large gift store. Next to it is the Yellowstone visitor center. From here you can walk thru town, enjoy the gift stores, restaurants, ice cream and much more.
Most likely you will have to move your car from the charger before you’re done exploring town as these Supercharger are so fast."
"We definitely didn’t know how to do park 😂 but figured it out for the next one laid out this way. Lots of openings, so no worries."
"We did a summer ""cross country"" trip from Colorado-Ontario (Canada). This was one of the better stops with kids. Lots of space for them to run around, shade and a large grocery store with bathrooms.

The only thing here is the grocery store (in walking distance), but it has pretty much everything you could need for a quick charge stop."
"We didn't see it on our map, but someone told us about the supercharger station un The Collective Marketplace shopping center. There were at least 10 spots. Lots of shops and restaurants to kill time in while you're waiting too."
"We didnt have issues with charges being blocked, but the parking lot was empty on the days we were there.

We had a great experience at buckees and the charging speeds."
"We got there. We charged, and we left. Husband charges here all the time, on some days we go to Panera bread. Clean and quiet"
"We just finished a 2,400 mile road trip from Plano, TX to Phoenix, AZ and back. Super charging was easy and convenient to the highways.  I-40 from Dallas to Phoenix and I-10 to I-20 to I-30 on the way home.  While some sites included amenities, many sites did not include amenities, such as restrooms. The worst was behind an out of business Sonic drive-in.
But the great news was that all chargers were working, and we never had to share a charger on a V2.  The costs at the charging were higher than expected.  The available info on the website was that the national average was $0.28 per kWh. Texas was $0.42 per kWh. New Mexico was $0.32 per kWh. Arizona was time-based, ranging from $0.11 to $0.42 per kWh.  At highway speeds, we averaged three miles per kWh."
"We love Tesla!
However this charging station is the hardest to find and is in the middle of nowhere!
By far the worst location!!!
Tesla also needs to add more than just backup stations they need some drive thru one for cars hauling trailers (pulling a trailer is not recommended as it drains the battery from 306 down to 90 miles)"
We love this location!  The sandwiches are the best at the Poncha market.
"We made 2 stops here during the Thanksgiving break. When heading West the right is a bit snaky and comes up quick. After making the second right into the hotel parking lot you'll find 6 stalls on your right. The first trip required no wait and charging was fast. On the way back, there was a 30 minute wait before getting started and we ended up spending just over an hour here.

The owner was friendly and spent some time explaining the politics of charging while we waited. We bought a few snacks and were allowed to use the restrooms. Very basic stop, but required for most traveling I-10."
"We made 2 stops here over the Thanksgiving holiday. Neither required a wait to begin charging, and were done before we could finish lunch across the parking lot at Cooper's. A solid choice if you enjoy pit BBQ."
"We made it from Great Falls, Montana to Fort MacLeod, Canada with 19% remaining. Navigation said we would have 9% remaining so we drove under the speed limit to the border. 2021 Model S Plaid. Four adult passengers. Charged to 100%. Attractive lady at border patrol."
We need more chargers in this location! It’s mid point between Miami and Orlando yet we only have 6 stalls does not make sense at all. Even with the new limitation. It makes it unpractical to drive a Tesla for long trips.
We only stopped here to charge for twenty minutes.  I was unaware of the secret Tesla bathroom access which would have been helpful but I didn't read the reviews.  Dangit.  Chargers are behind a casino.  All was well.
We only stopped here to charge our Tesla since it was close to the Best Western Hotel we were staying at. You have to go in and hee the front desk clerk and he unlocks it for you once you pay him $25 US. The front  desk older male clerk was very kind and friendly. He helped us as much as he could. The technology of this charging centre is very outdated.Hence the 3 star rating. Tesla needs to update this charging location It took all night to charge it 15%.  Thankfully the hotel was a 5 minute walk away. We left it and walked back to pick it up the next morning.
"We plugged in, the first charger wasn’t working. Sometime in the night all the chargers stopped working. We barely had enough charge in the morning to get to a supercharger - only had 5% when we got there."
"We pulled into this location for some go-go juice and yes it is early or late(depends on your prescriptive), well lit. Not real great options for the facilities if and when you need to go while you are charging and nothing is open yet for business.  If you pull in during normal business hours, there are lots of options and things to do."
"We recently visited a Tesla Supercharging station in Kingman, AZ.  The charging stalls were clean and clearly marked, making it easy to find an available spot. The charging connectors were in good condition and worked smoothly. It was also nice to have amenities to choose from such Carl's Jr. w/restrooms and seating while we waited for the car to charge.

I would highly recommend it to other Tesla owners looking to charge their electric vehicle."
We stayed at Bryce Canyon Inn because of the Tesla destination chargers and it's proximity to Bryce Canyon itself. We had a nice 1 bedroom cabin for two nights. There's a coffee shop that doubles as the front check in area and there's a pizza place close by. The view of the landscape is really cool.
"We stop here a lot. It's convenient for the trips I take, easily accessible off the highway, and the Stewarts has a clean bathroom and plenty of snack food for the rest of the trip. It's also one of the early supercharger locations that can charge cars other than Tesla. It didn't have a real impact on me other than the fact that I had to press the button on the charging cable to unlock it from the charging station. That seems different."
"We stopped at the supercharger site this morning. It was a very good experience. The superchargers were in a great location. Within walking distance, the Bramble Berry Cafe was open and the baked goods were just coming out of the oven. We had coffee and muffins and wandered a bit in the very interesting and full antique shop. Nearby is a Jamaican Bread shop (closed this morning) and a winery shop and another shop full of yard art and other crafts. If you are craving fast food, there is a Wendy’s across the road near the Pilot gas station. Highly recommend the bakery!"
"We stopped at this 250kw x 11 charge station near a Target store on 1/13/2023 at 3:00pm.  4 of 11 chargers were in use. We charged our M3 long range from 37% to 85% in 20 minutes.

We used it again on 1/15/2023, arriving at 10:25am with 5 of 11 chargers in use. We charged our M3LR from 27% to 63% in 26 minutes (noticeably slower than our first visit)."
"We stopped here at night. Great charging session, best lit charger station i've ever seen.  Coffee/food establishment seems cool. Wish we had visited while it was open.  I would definitely stop by here again."
"We stopped here on 6/11/2022 about 3:30pm.  There were 2 of 8 spots in use. We charged our M3 long range from 35% to 80% in 16 minutes. Initial charge rate was 205 kwh but dropped as the battery filled. There was a new series of EV chargers being built very near to the Tesla chargers, with a construction fence around them.  There are lots of stores and food choices in the area, but most of them are drive to and not walk to."
We stopped here on the way to Fort Worth from Austin. Collin Street Bakery adjacent to the station is a nice place for a meal and coffee.
We stopped to change here a number of times during our vacation in Louisville.  It's a busy charging site but there was always at least one open charger.  The chargers worked great.  There's a cute coffee shop across the road which was an added bonus.
"We traveled from Eugene Oregon to Emmett Idaho in our Tesla model S. Our first Supercharge was in Bend. The station was located in the parking lot of Fred Myers. Our next Supercharge was Hains, Oregon at a stripmall (Burns.) Next charge was in Ontario at a Walmart lot. These superchargers are well located, clean and well lit. Never more than two cars at all of them."
"We tried stopping by the tesla charging destination at rock fish. The food was good, but the charging station didnt work. The manager at the restauarant said their charging station didnt work with newer models (ours was a 2019 Model S). They tried restarting the station, but it didnt work. We tried one last time after dinner and it still didnt work. I am not sure why but it might work for older models, but definetly not for newer models. Pretty disappointed. (FYI we visited september 2020)."
"We tried the end charger that sticks out and it was only capable of 35 kW, so we moved to the DD side and picked a different one that was putting out 115 kW which helped speed up the process immensely"
We used the far right standard (not Tesla) Clipper creek charge. Was free And fast charged from 66% to 96% in 1hr
We used these chargers several times on our trip. Chargers on both sides of the aisle! Including one on the side for pull-in. Plenty of them. Steady usage.
"We used this charger on the 13 and 16 of January 2023 and it was filthy on both occasions.  The chargers are fast but the actual area is very unkept by, what I must assume, are other Tesla drivers. So much garbage on, around or in the path of the charging stations."
"We visited the casino and buffet on a concert night. We had to stand in line for the buffet to wait for tables to open up. They had a sign up explaining they were short staffed like so many other places, which I understand.  There was one long table with Reserved signs on it that nobody ever sat at - I am thinking that was probably related to short staffing and trying to keep up. I don't eat meat so I asked if I could order the kids grilled cheese and fries, which they were nice enough to let me. I was actually surprised how fast my meal came considering, and it was hot and fresh. My husband had the buffet for $25 because he has always been about quantity over quality.  When he left food on his plate and only made two trips through,  you know it's BAD! He said the selection was way down from when he has been there in previous years. He said the food was just gross. He admitted my idea of picking up pizza in Mandan would have been much better.

We did wander around the casino area for a little while before and after the concert.  The layout is not crowd friendly, as there are so many machines jam packed in there that you add a few people and there is not much room to move.

I thought the concert hall was extremely warm, and I am the one that is always cold, so it had to have been bad! Our seats were right under a light on the side wall, which glared in our eyes and made it hard to watch people coming and going while we waited for the concert to begin."
"We visited this 150kw x 8 charger station on 1/13/2023 at 1:30pm. We found all 8 chargers open upon arrival.  We charged our M3 long range from 29% to 67% in 13 minutes.

Located in a Meijer lot with no other amenities within walking distance but 2 dozen fast food places along the drive in from US65 to the chargers.

We stopped again on a return trip 1/15/2023 at 12:30pm. There were 5 of 8 chargers in use.  Charged our M3LR from 33% to 79% in 28 minutes.

Only 4 stars because this is obviously a popular spot but it has the older 150kw chargers.  We parked next to a model X that was there before we arrived, and still there when we left. They must have need an hour to charge."
"We visited this place on our way from Dallas to San Antonio. We reached there with 50% or more charge and as it was V3 super chargers, gave good place. About 22-24 super chargers available. Clean and nice place to stop and grab some baked goodies or cafe stuff from the Collin street bakery next to it. 😋"
We were able to charge and get lots of errands and shopping done while we waited. Great location!
"We were able to get about 44-45 miles per hour with our Model 3. Thank you, Landmark Resort!"
We were buried in snow and stopped at this charger. Great charge and solid lighting. 10/10! Thanks you 😊
"We were headed I95 south towards I4. Way off the beaten path from I95. Or navigation didn't give the best direction. Located in a shopping complex with salons and message salon too, among places to eat.  Charging station is near Chuck E Cheese."
"We were here very late at night. There were two of us, so I felt safer. But, it was very dark around the chargers, and with all the shops closed for the night, I would have been less comfortable if I’d been traveling alone."
"We were led here by the navigation in our Tesla MS. Pulled up and plugged in. 10 minutes later an angry woman stormed out yelling that the chargers were for her guests only and we were trespassing on private property. She demanded $10, which we gladly paid. But decided to immediately unplug and move on."
We were not happy that you have to valet your Tesla to charge overnight. $$$ We chose to self-park and use  SuperCharger.
We were the only car there during memorial weekend. It's in the parking lot of Blanding Visitor's Center who kindly put a note on the restroom door to remind people about the first year ever timed entry reservation of Arches National Park. I was able to get a reservation online the day before at 6pm. But without that note I wouldn't think of checking and would have been turned away at the park entrance. The parking lot had a little lawn for fur friends.
We were the only one there most of the time and charged quickly.
"We were thrilled to find out that this Tesla Supercharger had opened just a couple of days before our trip from DeKalb to Grinnell, Iowa. We didn't have to backtrack to the N. Aurora charger which saved almost an hour. Casey's has snacks, restroom, and friendly staff. The day we returned two of the chargers weren't working but Casey's staff informed us that Tesla service out of Chicago was on their way so while it was a bit annoying to have to try another charger, the three of us juicing up were able to get our power and be on the road."
"We were traveling and only reason we stayed in this Marriott hotel is because it has tesla supercharger on site. I was blocked at night and again in morning by construction workers to supercharge because they were doing some paint job on the road in the hotel premises. When asked where i should i charge: one of the worker said , I don’t know , may be you should remove your tires and take your vehicle away. Also hospital front desk has no idea. This is the way they treat customers. Tesla should remove its supercharger site from this area to a different area. I am traveling with my family and the next charge area is in Albuquerque. What a tragedy"
we’re limping through a charge w zero cars here and only 68 Kw.    Not so great imho.
We’ve charged here several times and have never waited.  Bathrooms are in the Best Western Hotel.  The nearby Dairy Queen has a walk up window (there is always a long line for the drive thu!) - yum.  We stopped in at the lovely and newly relocated Sheridan Stationary and Books - directly across the street from Dairy Queen.  In addition to books they also have trading cards and other cute gifts.  We left with some football cards and two regionally history books - and a fully charged car.
Weekend is very busy.
"Weird location to find without knowing about it beforehand. Only accessible easily coming from the south side of the mall. Once there it's a decent area, but with a pretty large amount of foot traffic around the cars at times.

Being walking distance from the mall with all it's services is great however, and the chargers are both reliable and rarely full."
"Weird spot in town but it's a good charging area spot if you're going up towards Calgary, towards Waterton, lethbridge or towards the states. There are a couple of food joints nearby if you need food with decent ratings on Google."
"Weis supermarket with clean rest room and liquor store nearby. They're building something else as of July 2019 as well, I'll upload photo. Charger 1a worked great for me. Also, free air pump available which is great!"
Well
Well come on ...its like getting a FREE TANK OF GAS for me...and considering the gas prices at the moment...who doesn't love a Tesla Supercharger...although this particular one is a bit on the slow side compared to the one just across the freeway in Greenbrae.. thats my FAVORITE...its faster fir my car than any of the 250 chargers Ive tried 🙃
Well it’s a quick charge but nothing much else.  No restroom or dining options in the immediate vicinity except a portable potty across the street.  At a couple miles off I-10 it’s kind of a random place for a charger.
Well kept premises. Nearby station store with drinks & snacks plus clean restrooms.
Well laid out location with adequate space to drop a trailer if you are towing.
"Well laid out stalls (if only users actually paid attention).  Carl's JR is located very close with clean restrooms and decent food.  It was super windy during this visit, and given the location it can get quite dusty..."
"Well let, conveniently located, easy access in and out, multiple charging stations, all in all one of the better charging places we visited."
"Well lit & easy access. Plenty of places within minutes to (walk) grab a bite, use the restrooms or stretch your legs."
"Well lit and always an available spot. Near stores, so charge and shop at the same time!"
"Well lit and clean, not a lot of chargers but convenient to 395. East walk to McDonalds and a skatepark if you are so inclined."
"Well lit and perfect location with food and shopping in Turkey Creek area. Right off the highway , good pit stop for gas or electric charge"
"Well lit area. Convenient, right off interstate.  Not even close to 250kw speed though"
"Well lit, at Casey's. They have provided trash receptacles and window washing. NICE TOUCH"
"Well lit, newer chain hotels nesrby. Close proximity to the highway"
"Well lit, next to a big well stocked gas station, has some windshield squeegees! Didn’t see many other walkable food or rest locations"
"Well lit, working chargers. Close proximity to fast food. Trash cans available next to hotel."
Well located in downtown Sheridan. 150kW max but it’s not an issue if you’re stopping for a meal at any of the nearby restaurants. Be mindful of the median if you’re trying to make a left out of the lot onto Main Street. At night it’s extremely dark and difficult to see. There should be a no left turn sign. Take the alley north to the next block instead.
Well located Tesla charging station ….
Well located with a Sheetz on the property incl WIFI. Only issue are ICE vehicles in the charging spots occasionally.
Well maintained and conveniently located outside of Meijer. Culver's is in the same lot too.
"Well mIntained with Level 3 chargers.
Dennys nearby is great for pit stops.
El Pollo Loco has their dknkng room AND RESTROOMS open until 9PM."
"Well placed charger! Good amenities (Dempseys has great food) and the home decor shop is cute af.

The chargers are right off the highway and tucked behind Dempseys"
"Well that's a new one. The Tesla network has the incorrect address for this charger. NOT near the car wash, this is near the BP station across from McDonalds."
"Well-maintained, a 5-minute walk to good food.

This supercharger location delivers one of the most consistent charges (across all stalls) in the area. I have noticed significant variation amongst Tesla superchargers even when all other factors are similar (# of vehicles charging, my battery level, etc.). Many superchargers have variable rates of charge from one stall to the next, even if all the stalls are empty."
"Well, the Comfort Inn seems to still be amenable to Tesla charging folks using the restrooms. Otherwise there’s a Love’s and Subway across 4 lanes of Highway. Charging is pretty fast."
"Well, there are 3 tesla plugs here amd one third party.  None of those tesla ones are working, and I dont even bother with the 3rd party one.  What a shame, i guess all these chargers are just for decoration.  No one bother to maintain them...."
"Well, they have a 8 stall and they get pretty busy over the weekend so be careful"
"Wendy's,  Target and Stop n Shop.  Great spot to charge"
Went for a quick charge. Wasn’t disappointed.
Went here to charge but was blocked. See all the gas cars that block EV chargeing. What can be done?
"Went late night
Felt perfectly safe"
What a great location for a Tesla SC! So much to do within walking distance. 12 stalls is great! Super fast 250KW charging.
"What a great place to stop!  Need more superchargers because this place is very busy.  Safe, clean and amenities galore."
What a joy it was to find a new Tesla Supercharger near our alma mater. Our reunion went well and it was stress-free because we knew that we could stop by the Kum n Go to get power whenever we needed it. The gas station has all you need when traveling. With fuel prices so high we got some envious looks as we plugged in. Great addition to the Tesla network.
"What a location. This was the first time I can think of that I wished that a supercharger was slower so I could enjoy the view and blue skies longer.

Not a ton in the way of walkable distance amenities nearby, but it's impossible to complain about that in a location this nice. I'd have loved to spend more time in Creston beyond just passing through. Glad these chargers are new and exist and are reliable, and can't wait to be back."
What can I say - it works. The amenities are just ok. It very functional
"What can I say, it’s SUPER quick 😂 Cheap, and right next to the WAWA for some snacks while you wait 👌🏼"
What can I say? It’s a Tesla Supercharger network. They always work…
What can I say? It’s a Tesla Supercharger… they always work.
"What can you say about a Tesla charging station. We did not have any trouble with the charging equipment. There were plenty to do nearby, thus making it a good place to park and charge. Would park here again!"
What great little downtown! I loved stopping in Sulfur Springs to charge up.
"What he'll remember is the wind, blowing in relentlessly from the desolate landscape to the east, the sand pinging against the six superchargers (available 24/7, up to 150kW). He'll forget about the capacious bathroom in the adjacent Holiday Inn Express, and the  Silver Moon Cafe and DQ Grill & Chill located conveniently nearby. Just the incessant wind, bearing the tantalizing scent of dead roadrunner."
What is the info on this free charger why was it installed in such a terrible location is a stolen Tesla charger someone had wired up?
"When charging at this station you'll get some real good views. It's also at a Sheetz Gas Station so you'll be able to go to the restroom, grab a drink and food as well."
"When I first stopped here, I found all four Tesla destination chargers blocked by gas vehicles all night. Chargers were located close to front door with no signage so people just parked there. The hotel manager informs me that they now have signage on all the electric vehicle parking spots in order to prevent ICE vehicles parking there. They deserve five stars for taking this action. Recommend trying this hotel if you drive a Tesla."
When I go charge nice place also to grab something to eat when charging
"When I plugged the car in, it said it would take 40mim to charge. I set a timer on my phone, and went inside to eat. I came out 40min later to find the vehicle or charger stopped the charge at 80%, and so it had been idle for some time. I later discovered that I was going to be charged idle time fee, which makes no sense since it should not have been idle, It should have continued charging."
"When I'm here, I'm usually the only Tesla charging at a very busy WaWa.  More often than not, ICE drivers stop to ask me curious questions (how long does it take to charge?  how far can you go on a charge?).  People are VERY friendly.  WaWa has extra clean restrooms, fresh sandwiches, etc.  There's also a Total Wines liquor store nearby, and a Home Depot."
When my pp get big and battery got smol I go here
"When Tesla navigated us to this supercharger, most charging stations were offline, fortunately 1 station is working, otherwise we screwed. I hope there will be some indicators either via the app or on the station telling us its status"
"When we arrived, there was a vintage car show happening with the locals in the Holiday Inn parking lot. But they parked their vintage cars in the Tesla stalls. We quickly grabbed the last available stall before they parked there last car. Good luck charging if there is a car show."
"When we arrived, there were no other cars charging. It's right next to a mall so it's an easy place to visit a restroom if necessary. A quiet location and all the stations were working."
When you enter the pink garage immediately turn left to go down to floor 2 (from floor 3) and the chargers will be on your right. It looks like this is where the Tesla showroom keeps all their vehicles charged for test drives. So make sure you grab one of the urban supercharger spots instead of the wall chargers. Trash cans are towards the elevators.
When you need one...here it is. I must have driven by once.
"When you're on a family trip and you have made plans to charge to 100%. It's absolutely maddening to be limited to 80%. It's even more maddening when you see that only three out of the eight stations are busy. I've been a proud Tesla owner since 2015 and an investor since before then. I love what they're doing but they can do better here.

I fully understand that there are busy holiday times but this was not a busy holiday. This was a Monday night on a non-holiday weekday. Yes, it was the evening when everyone leaves the park but that's very predictable and we need more superchargers.

It seems like every road trip I go on I run into some kind of limitation of availability or some mitigation Tesla has put in place for limited availability.

It's time to grow up Tesla You're only going to be more popular from here on out."
When you're the only car it maxes out at 112kw website shows 250kw. Then when 1 other car there it drops to 40kw. I tried changing spots too. There's 8 chargers here. Did the electrician know what they were doing?
"Whenever I need to charge my Tesla, I always turn to the Tesla Supercharging Station. It's fast, convenient and really easy to use. The staff is friendly and helpful and I never feel rushed when I'm there. This is truly a great service for Tesla owners!"
"Whenever visiting the area, I stop here. Calaveras County has its own independent phone service, ranches, and a beautiful area to cruise around. The car really hugs the road. Nearby the charging station, within walking distance, are a convenience store, a full bar and eateries including an ice cream shop."
Where
"Where is the charger?

All the way in the rear beside Zoe's Kitchen & Sagamore Concierge Services  > the  B Good restaurant folded.. Chipotle is 150 forward from the charger .

Decent enough spot for a walk while charging.. the shops are all over priced.. the food meh in several spots.. better in others.. I can't get a wifi signal there .. you likely need a passcode from one of the dining spots nearby... & the rest rooms?.. well the nearby sign is there pointing aimlessly into the lot..  are you just supposed to pop a squat off a street lamp post?  Don't know... not walking into a restaurant to use the restroom without a buy though...
The charger speed is adequate..  this charger  location still beats the Wawa near 295 timewise from my multiple charges at both spots.... it's also quieter with less nasty smelly diesel traffic from rt 73.. 065-in"
"While just three cars were there, including me, the charge rate was about 60 even though I preconditioned."
"While only 4 supercharger spots here, they had been updated a few years ago and have been dependable. There have been a few times when I had to wait, but not very long. With the other Folsom Supercharger offering more options for food and shopping, this one tends to be forgotten."
"While renting a Tesla 3, I charged it up at this location twice. It is quite and conveniently located in the parking lot of Royal Farms. Great coffee and decent breakfast offerings."
"While staying Vero Beach for the week, we had a long drive up to the highway to charge. Came to find all stalls full with one car waiting (and one stall out of commission), so I came back later that night. Clearly a lot of demand in this area!"
"While the Charleston Place Hotel is simply magnificent, the super charger is 40 miles per hour charge. Love this 5.0!!! Hotel where the service is classic awesome. 😎"
"While the location itself is fine, I find the placement of this supercharger to be bad. Cars zip right along the path next to it, making backing into a spot a bit dangerous."
"While the proprietor was nice, neither worked and haven’t for a long while."
"While this is only a 150 kW charger, I rarely see half the stalls full even on a weekend.  The typical use is 3-4 cars there in Fall 2021.  Convenient in-and-out with the mall and Starbucks within walking distance."
"While visiting Bradenton, we got in much later than we anticipated but needed to charge to be ready for the morning. After locating the nearest Supercharger, I pull up and the entrance is locked. The security guard was nice enough to let me in to charge. Good thing because I didn't have enough of a charge to make it to the next supercharger."
Who cares where the power comes from you freak. You seem to think ev should only be powered by fairy dust and unicorn farts. Go back to California
Who the heck ever though of putting charging station on to a PAID parking garage?! It charges slowly even though I was the only one there (Tesla claims that more users make the charging slower....so promissed 170mil/ 1/2hour was only around 100miles/hour.... 1 HOUR IN GARAGE IS 5$
"Whoever either painted/spaced the lines, or whoever installed the chargers did so in a pretty bad manner. Lots of parking spots don’t align correctly with any of the stalls. So you’re forced to look dumb and park on lines or bend cables to get them to the car for charging.

Besides that the charging rates here keep going up by a lot. With the amount of surface area the mills mall has you’d think there would be enough solar harvesting around to offset some costs but that only seems to be a EU thing apparently.

Overall could be improved upon greatly."
Whole station was down on Saturday. Big fail.  We lucked out by stopping at the Wolseley Motel in Wolseley Saskatchewan further down the TransCanada highway which gave us access to their destination charger.  Whitewood’s Petro-Canada station has high speed chargers but only for CCS and Chademo connectors. Our J  1772 adapter was of no use.
"Whole strip mall of amenities and a grocery store. There is also a sign that says “more stalls 3 miles down the road” as there is limited space and stalls at this one. But it’s right off the highway so, it’s really convenient."
"why are people upset this is not a supercharger? It never advertised itself as such, the name is ""destination charger"". Research first before you go"
"Why do they keep putting these superchargers in hotel parking lots with no amenities? The best ones are at 24hr Super Convenience stores with restaurants, groceries, and public restrooms."
"Why is there no tesla super charger in Killeen, Texas? I hate the fact there is military installation (FT Hood) with 55,000 plus troop on ground there is not one super charger in the area! The chargers that I would find either broken or not in operation status! When I did find one, it took forever to charge (8kw)! Tesla, you need to a better job placing a charger station in a high population outside the major cities! Because your low range tesla's can't make it to every charger if they are not in range of 225 miles!"
"why isn’t this SC in PlugShare?? great location
and most spots are in the shade !

just sitting here charging and some people in a Saab roll up and park right in the supercharger spot. couple people here for charging made a comment and this guy starts flipping the flip out, cursing. so i told him, calmly, just because “can” park here (sign says “ all vehicles”) doesn’t mean you “should” park here when there are at least 30 others non EV spots. his wife becomes triggered and says she’s dialing 911.... cra cra people. surely future Tesla customers ...."
"Why, tax dollars for no reason."
Wide open access! Thanks
Wide open and full charge speeds!!
"Wide open chargers, but the area was busy.  Picnic tables nearby with a little shade."
Wide open when we got there on a Friday mid-day. Very convenient off of I-44
Wine and Roses hotel has two Tesla charging stations and one other. People leave their vehicles for hours! It charges 26 miles per hour!
"Winter hours of nearby business may mean you won’t have amenities, but charging is easy to access right off the main road from the highway. Also, there are CCS chargers right next to the Tesla superchargers."
"Wish it were higher than 150kWh considering it's the only one in Waco. But it's located in a great spot right off the highway. There's a hotel next door, and Collin Street Bakery on the other side to use the restroom, and get some great baked goods. 4 star was only because I wish it were a 250kWh station."
Wish there was a squeegee and garbage were next to the chargers. Bathrooms in mall are clean.
Wish there was some more options for restrooms & snacks. The store is not always open but they were very nice when it was open! Great place to walk my puppy around and stretch out my legs. There was a station across the street and a lot of food options on this exit for snacks or meals. Fast charger as well!
Wish there were more walkable food offerings nearby. There are a few department stores to pass time if desired. We have never came close to the 120kw charging rate. At 60 with 1 other car at 2A while we were at 4B.
With my 60 kW battery half charged only got 32 kW of power on a Sunday morning at less than half full.   Must be flow limited.  Behind the Panera drive thru.  More development underway.
With Tesla opening up to all ev's hope there is a waiting time or get in line scene.
"Within walking distance to BJ's restaurant and brewery, Costco, In-n-out, Chipotle and more!"
"Won’t let anyone that is not a hotel guest use the chargers, even if you offer to pay and there is an open station."
Wonderful . Need more and need to replace slower ones with faster versions especially Champaign IL .
"Work well, but ends are aging and could be replaced"
"Worked as advertised and was full when I arrived with a motorcycle in one of the stalls.  Chargers are Next to holiday inn but if you plan to grab a bite at Macdonalds, be ready to drive there because it’s not walkable."
Worked as expected. Quite a bad part of town though. Don't recommend at night.
"Worked as promised. 8 chargers at the location and a gas station to buy personal fuel "" coffee soda etc..)"
Worked flawlessly.
Worked flawlessly. Was exploring the area in the meantime since it was a beautiful day.
Worked good. But in this hear 106 was charging slower. Could be the car to though. Lol. But nice easy to get to and working chargers
Worked great charging up my Rivian R1T. Plenty of open spots during midweek but It got busy on a weekend in mid Oct though. Three Rivian R1T charging at the same time on Sat.
Worked great for parking a diesel 3500 and gooseneck trailer. Thanks Elon for the designated parking!
"Worked great however a late model ba
Black Corvette looked permanently parked in the far left charging station"
"Worked great, starbucks in the parking lot."
Worked great.
Worked great.  Account for $9 park entry fee.  Convenient since we stayed at Potawatomi Inn.  2 Tesla chargers and one Clipper Creek charger.
Worked great. 12 charging stations. Short detour. 24 Hours fast food and convenient stores at a short drive
"Worked great. Didn’t have to wait for a spot right before lunch, but it filled up by the time I got back."
worked just fine
"Worked perfectly. Fairly popular charging station, we charged twice and there was at least one other Tesla there. We ate at Sonic across the street while the car was charging. There is also a Dairy Queen next to Kum and Go."
"Worked well, 8 chargers are separated into 2 groups of 4, one of which is near the drive thru making them somewhat of a challenge to get into. Home Depot, sporting goods and a little strip mall as well as the obvious Arby's."
Worked well. 48 amp charger so about 10kw/hr or around 37 miles/hr?
Worked! Bathrooms were clean. Nice truck stop.
"Working and easy to find, near Fred Meyer."
Working as expected. Clean and some food options close.
Working now as of this post
"Works as expected.
But always some other vehicle parked at charging station!"
"Works as it should, but the location was a little challenging to find the first time. 8 stalls, 7 back-in style and 1 pull-in style."
Works as it should. Located in the Hard Rock Casino hotel parking lot. Valet will come and pick you up and take you to the front. Lots of food and restrooms.
Works but only for restaurant customers. Not a destination charger.
Works but slow at 24A 5kW.
"Works fine, second day both charging stations were full, but I had enough to get me down the mountain"
"Works good and fine, but the location kind of sucks compared to others next to like Sheetz or a grocery store to rest stop at."
Works great
Works great and close to the shops. Model 3 and was pulling 33mi/hr
"Works great, and it's free. I was getting as high as 36mph charge speed today!"
"Works great, but the owner may shut it off if not used much. Just ask, really nice guy."
"Works great, there are two Tesla chargers that are right in front of the auto museum, next to a covered pavilion. Each charger has their own pedestal. We were able to charge at 48 amps, free for hotel guests."
Works great. Eight chargers. Food with walking distance. No pinball machines tho!
Works great. I think 24v
"Works great. It's behind the hotel. One charging spot. It's not a Tesla-specific charger, would work with other cars. Need a an adaptor for tesla. Will stay at this hotel any time I'm in green bay now that I found a place with a charger"
Works great. Restricted location. You have to be a guest with a parking permit to access this location. It’s located just west of the base of the foot bridge in the parking lot.
"Works just like the rest, no trash cans though. Nice place to sleep if you're driving though the night because the parking lot is dimmer than most."
Works like how it should for a Tesla Destination Charger.
"Works perfect as expected. The other day when we were there we saw 2 model 3s. One was from DC, and the other was from Missouri. Awesome. Stopped by to charge, and all these cool trucks were going by in a parade!"
"Works perfectly, both stalls were working and free!"
Works well
Works well but only for hotel guests.   Staff at the hotel was amazing.
"Works well, good availability. 40 cents / kWh though! Holy cannoli maybe it's just me but that seems higher than usual out here in the Midwest."
Works well!
Works! Hose and location are great. I wish there was a pinball place close!
Worse super charger. Parking line is not aligned with charger stalls
"worst charger location Ive ever used.. the spots are so tight i was afraid to leave the vehicle for fear of door dings..  tesla drivers are the worst at backing into tight spots !!  many took 2 spots as the spot alongside was unusable ..trash everywhere around.. lot striping non existent..  horrible charger location. & here I  thought driving past the  Tannersville""s Outlet garbage cans was bad.. I will avoid this location  if I can in the future"
"Worst charging stop ever. I always have problems charging here. My Model X Plaid won’t charge with one of the stalls  today, and last time we were here there were THREE stalls that weren’t working. The bathrooms nearby are disgusting. Unfortunately, we always have to stop here because there are no other chargers between Draper and Beaver."
Worst electric cars on the market by far! The steering wheels fall off.
"Worth going to, eventhough it's often very full, if only to see so many Teslas in one place at a time. In N.M. you're not allowed to buy a Tesla in state, so it's delivery only. A new maintenance shop opened north of Santa Fe."
"Worth the drive up to the top of the parking garage.  As you drive up ramps take hard lefts for fastest route up to top floor. 24 total chargers on rows of 12, 10 and 2 stations."
Worthy of the always requested ZERO STARS. Seriously!!! Seriously??? 8 pitiful charging stalls (only 7 working) @ 150 kW max which is only mid 30's in reality. Shameful when it's a must stop to and from San Diego.
"Would be 5 stars but the location is only convenient to the highway. Food is a walk and there are not many options. However, the chargers worked great. Full speed supercharging at its best. Now if we can get Tesla to put a few more of these in at various locations on long the interstate to make travel between states better, that would be great!"
Would be better if they put a garbage can some where by them
Would be nice to be able to use if you're not a guest since there is no other chargers near the area.
Would give 0 stars if we could. Not only do you pay for the garage but they are ripping you off requesting $35 cash ON TOP OF the payment for the garage and on top of the fee to charge. Beware.
Would have posted a 5 if it was only used as EV charging.  Arrived late on electric fumes and was frustrated to find non EV cars parked there.  Got further frustrated when I later find out it was hotel staff taking the spots and hotel would do nothing about it.  Other than that it was free and convenient to hotel
Wouldn’t advice to go here at night. The place is secluded and is located next to a farm area. Lots of mosquitos and other insects around the area. Also the place is a little scary if around evenings.
Wow .. atlast found a cheaper Tesla charging station … generally I pay around $0.34 in other wawa stations but this one costed 0.27$ I think . It’s obviously far from where I live but I was visiting Medford and found this one . Mostly occupied but I had one empty station. Nice and quick charging at 250KW. Thumbs up overall
"Wow 51 stalls!!! Biggest SC station I’ve been too. Much needed. With my 75D I could never get to Grants Pass before after Myrtle Creek or Springfield and would have to sleep overnight in Roseburg, now with this we can finally keep moving down and up I5 without hiccup. We got here at 10pm and the Taco Bell and Subway both were still open, subway even has a drive through. Starbucks is also nearby but you have to walk a little further. Decently lit at night."
Wow have I been waiting for this super charger to open.  It was a needed charging station.  It is located in the Mel’s restaurant parking lot.  There is beautiful views and photo opportunities.  I feel safe here in the day as a Tesla Diva rolling in at night if feel a bit scared.  Be safe pulling out of here at night cars go fast it’s dark and the roads are country roads.  I definitely would come back to this charging.  Maybe next time I’ll try Mel’s.  I heard it’s pretty good.
"Wow it's a Tesla charging station the middle of the mountains, Blackwater falls State Park Lodge.  Free charging Philip on your electric car plug-in hybrid.  Is welcome news since everything is running on natural gas now in West Virginia it's even better that they're going the next step."
Wow!  300 miles per hour!  Charging at home is 4 miles per hour.  Very fast charging.
"WOW!!! This charger is amazing! It charged my Tesla! As far as chargers go, this charger was a great charger! I would come back to this hotel and pay for a room JUST to use this charger! You go, charger!"
Wow. Never saw a truck stop or gas station this large with so much food and shopping. Chopped brisket was awesome. Fresh fruit was great. Unbelievable number of gas pumps. Hugh bathrooms. Amazing fresh beef jerky.
"Wow. This place was cool. Not only were there numerous gas pumps. But it’s like a mini home goods store, restaurant and convenience store. This is my first time being in one of these. Staff definitely makes you feel welcome when you enter"
Wow. What can I say. The superchargers are fast. The best part is coming here to charge between 6-9 AM for the awesome breakfast they offer at the hotel. I love to plug my car to charge. Take a leak and enjoy a good breakfast and take a coffee to go. Thank you Holiday Inn Express.
"Wow.... In the middle of BFE.... Interesting, I actually watched a Tesla pull up and plug in.... Then just sit in their car and ?? Mind blown"
"Ya this is a fine supercharger, in a good area for some nice food.  And not a Target"
yappers - I did the same while grabbing breakfast at waffle house.  clean and safe area.
"Yay! Finally, Tesla Superchargers in Big Spring. 250 kW! This is a welcome addition to what had been an EV charger desert. They're in the Porter's parking lot."
"Yeah only for guests.
I offered to purchase something from the hotel but they still deny even if the value of the item was more than the time spent charging. Like a bottle of wine for $30 from the lobby. Why are these even marked as available?"
"Yeah! It was working Aug. 27, 2020
Great location. In parking lot of Hotel / convention centre convenient for bathroom. Tim Hortons across the road."
Yep
"Yep, still vandalized."
"Yep, there is definitely a Tesla Charging station here."
yes busy location but not busy for charging...well lit at night... quick on and off freeway... if traffic isn't crazy...
Yes it is a zoo. Yes it will take a while to get to the restroom.  Yes there is chaos. Yes it is fun.
Yes it was charged very quickly than i expected
"Yes it’s hidden, but it’s in a great location next to a Mexican restaurant and decent gas station that you can walk to through the back of the parking lot. I gave 4 stars because the charging rate is pretty slow. I maxed out at 34kw, but spent most of the time around 30-32. It’s also a very busy station because it’s the only one between Houston and Austin/San Antonio. If you’re coming through on a weekend, you might have to wait for a spot to open up, so keep that I mind when planning your trip."
"YES! Post Ian Win. Here now Thursday 9/29 @ 10:30AM and even though it said it was offline a few times and then online here and there + currently says ""Short Wait"" there's nobody here but us and we're charging at a full 250 kW out the gate. Whew"
You can access this without reservation. Free juice!
"You can charge here just fine, but definitely a shady area. This is the sign posted next to the chargers.."
You can charge your car while you relax and eat
"You can definitely find a spot here, but doesn't seem like the greatest neighborhood. It is at a Sheetz 24 hour gas station. There is gas station food so you can grab a quick bite. Doesn't look like there is much else around. Also seems like non Tesla's park here as well as depicted in the picture."
You can get a charge here but frankly Anderson's Pea Soup has seen better days and the whole 20 minutes seems longer and dingier.
You can go to the Baker County Chamber of Commerce visiting center if you only have to use the bathroom and get information.  Sun Ridge Bar and Grill will not let you use the bathroom unless you are eating at restaurant or bar.  Weird because the Tesla charges are closer to the bar.
You can only be a hotel guest to use this. Or else you need to have an adapter and go charge at the mall.
You can see it from the Southbound off-ramp to the left.  It is hidden behind the Starbucks.  Due to traffic you may need to go further down to turn.  We turned in by the Olive Garden and drove back to it.  There is a lot of standing water here and a lot of gnats.  Hopefully this will be taken care of at some point.  Lots of restaurants within walking distance.
You don't have to leave the turnpike to charge which is convenient.  There is off peak pricing for charging.  I did not look for dining options but it is a rest stop so you will likely find typical fast food fare.
You enter from Clinton st. (not Taylor).  90 minutes of free parking with validation. No purchase necessary to validate at TJ Maxx.  Worked perfectly and was a great experience. 5th floor of the parking garage has the chargers.  72Kwh
You feel as if you have been put in isolation the chargers as so far from stores and food. They are great if you are towing because there is plenty of room to drop your trailer.
"You got to press a button at the gate .. a guard would look up plates and give you a code you got to enter code at the gate , once you in a voucher prints out and usually you get free candy if you go to the store at the link with the voucher , it says in the voucher .. so far the one with the most chargers I seen …make sure you not in the 11 kw area . … use the 250kw 🙂"
You gotta go to Skeet's Country Grill while you wait! It's a 2 minute walk. So freakin' good!!! I Don't understand why people complain about walking to the front door of the hotel. It's only a 30 second walk to get there.
You have to be a guest to use them.  And there arent any close. Dont come here if your low
"You have to get a guest pass at gate, then you have to drive to the Sonesta and ask the bellhop-they open a gate and then the charger is on the right. It is a slow charge, safe area, but somewhat of a hassle to get to and I’m not sure if it should be listed as I was asked if I was a guest, I wasn’t and they kindly let me in, but it felt odd. It was peaceful though on a rainy day!"
"You have to pay $2 parking fee, even if you’re only there to charge for a short amount of time."
You HAVE TO PAY $25 FOR PARKING
You have to pay for parking to get to the chargers on top of the charging fee. I can't see how anyone could rate this place higher than a 1 star.  In NJ they are all over the place and open to the public.  FREE WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY FOR PARKING.
You have to pay for the parking before you can access the charger. It’s $3 in addition to the charging fee. Location is inside a secured parking garage in a mall. Area is clean and the charger is fairly fast.
You have to rent a room to use the charger it is not free or open to the public. But the owner was was very kind to me and helped me out in a pinch.
You have to stay at the hotel to use the charger but the hotel was very nice and let me charge my Tesla that I picked up yesterday lol new to this and so happy they let me charge there😁
"You need to pull into the hotel parking where you give the valet $5. Felt safe and secure, but yes there were gas vehicles parked in a few of the spots; however, the cord was plenty long and I believe the valet will move the gas cars if need be so you can park there."
You should enter on the Macy’s side and then level G is all the way upstairs around near the roof. Level G does not mean Ground Floor! G is yellow and it’s ok the roof. Learned the hard way driving all around both sides of the mall and up and down.
You will be happy to know that Woodman's now has additional electronic vehicle charging which includes Tesla Supercharges! They're located directly behind the petrol station ⛽️ If you found this to be helpful hit the 👍
"You will want to turn right at the Oakhurst Inn white on red sign (before the lumber company) and drive around the right to the back. There are 2 back-in stalls on the left and 6 (?) drive forward stalls on the right. It is pretty tight. I wish there were Wi-Fi. If you walk out to Hwy 41 there are several restaurants close by. Very convenient charging if driving in to Yosemite and staying close by, for example at Bass Lake. It can be a little scary back there at night."
Your 2 parking spots are always full with regular cars.
"Your normal 8 way 150KWh Tesla supercharger. 132 second walk up the hill is a hotel.  26 second walk will take you to a sticky dairyqueen... normal germy country bumpkins run the place, would not recommend going there."
"Your standard back of a business charging station, with a medium charge rate, about 100 kw/h, next to an Applebee's and a cigar lounge. Pull in instead of back in, so a bit difficult to park. N not very clean, but a decent amount of free space for dogs nearby."
yummy zapping idea
Yup this one too. No wait and super fast as expected. Thx Tesla
"Yup, they are V3. We were tourists in this town on 7/5/21. Plugged in at 23% and it pulled 245KW. Thirteen minutes later it was up to 68%. See pics. Cost was about 10 bucks. Thanks Busy Bee to let Tesla putting V3 Supercharger here. Please put another Supercharger location at Destin FL area."
Zach was professional and accommodating to resolve issues to the best of allowable practices
