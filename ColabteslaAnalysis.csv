 The great thing about the fast v3 stalls is that by the time you use the (usually) clean toilets, place an order for hot food and then receive it, your Tesla is done with its snack and is good for the next leg of your trip. This Sheetz, like most others, has fantastic staff, a clean layout, and toilets you can access 24/7 (unlike strip mall based charging stops). It's also large enough to have an eating area so if you want to chill for a little longer and enjoy your greasy messy Big Mozz sandwich or something you can do so without getting your car all dirty. :)
 
 Traffic can be a little heavy at times, since this is a very good location for any kind of fueling up, but bonus points for putting the charging stalls near the drive-thru lane. Most of the non-tesla traffic on this side of the building is in the separate drive way to place the order which makes pulling into a spot a little easier. This partnership with Sheetz just gets better and smarter all the time!
 
 Not quite the best spot to charge before bailing onto 295 and avoiding the Richmond mess, but it's not far. You can do a short hop back to get to 295 or take the major local roads to meet back up with it!"

Instead of one or two row of chargers, Walterboro has 4 rows of parking slots (2x rows of back to back parking spots) which means if you're hauling a trailer you can pull across one row to park and still keep most of the charging spots open! (Yes it does have a ""pull in"" spot, but when the parking spot is still normal length it leaves your trailer blocking the parking row).
 
 It's right off 95, in a big strip-mall shopping center so you have lots of options to eat at, like KFC, or Poppa John's or IHOP. You've got GameStop and Dollar Tree if you need to pick up something to keep your passengers occupied, and there's a Walmart Supercenter at the end of the road in case you need anything else. All in all, this stop offers a lot of places to charge very quickly, and a lot to do while you're here.

Amenities and location,Positive,"Starbucks, Chipotle, Applebees",Area is full of restaurants from Starbucks to Chipotle to Applebees. The mall appeared clean and safety was not a concern.

Luckily I only needed another 30 Kwh to make it home with 17% remaining charge. This charger was more expensive and slower than a previous charger that I used. Look at my other review. Five stars for places to pass the time but one star for charging capability.

Once I figured out the parking situation (lines did not line up with ability to plug in) several other cars arrived. They are in the process of fixing parking lines, evidenced by spray paint. Charged fast, was done when we returned from a quick Walmart trip. Several places to shop or eat nearby. Bonus to this spot is that across the lane are other EV charger types. Smart. Another convenient spot to charge on trips up and down WA state. 4 stars due to the (lack of) parking guidelines."
Output: Accessibility and Location,Negative,The lines are painted wrong,"Arrived with 10%. Trundling along at 75-88kw. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m the only one here early in the morning.
 
 I have not scrolled through the other reviews so sorry if this has already been mentioned. The lines are painted wrong. If you park per them the SC is directly behind you instead of the left corner. Again I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m the only one here so I split the difference to line up correctly.
 
 Photo attached.
 
 Therefore the poor rating. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve never been here when it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s busy. I wonder if the misaligned spots cause a problem. I run a bike carrier so it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s crucial that the spots are lined correctly so that I can back up very close to the SC to reach the port.
 
 Otherwise nicely located fairly close to freeway and far enough from the entrances to discourage ICEing."

It was good before it lasted, I guess no more super early morning/late night charging sessions for me, for now."

 It took me about 31 minutes to charge from 37% to 88% in my Tesla Model 3 (Long Range, AWD), just enough time to walk over to Culvers, order, eat, and walk back.
 
 In the past, I've had problems with Stall 1A limiting charge rate to 23kW (even without being shared), but I haven't noticed this recently (still was charging at 50 kW at 80% charge).
 
 5 stars would be earned with additional restaurants being slightly closer and a covered awning/shelter for rainy/winter weather. Otherwise this location is great!"

Output 13: charging speed and efficiency,Neutral,I don't see a noticeable difference in these chargers,"EDIT (4/16/21):
 
 Well, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s been 2 weeks and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t see a noticeable difference in these chargers. Although, the two that use to not work at all appear to be operating at least. There were 6 vehicles here for one charge and I was getting 35kwh plugging in at 30%. I plugged in with two other vehicles at 20% and was getting 90kwh, and have gotten over 100kwh once when I was down to 10%. Overall, I expected to get over 100 anytime I was near 20% but that doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t appear to be the case, and by the time I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m up to 40-50% I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m down to around 40kwh. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s only been between 40-50 degrees, so I know that can slow it, but with 15mins to precondition and a couple days in the 60‚Äö√Ñ√¥s I just don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s going to be much better. Maybe my expectations were just unrealistic from a couple other V3 chargers I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been to.
 
 I can say up to 80% it is staying above 30kwh, which is better than I noticed previously.

 ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Very Versed‚Äö√Ñ√π in EVs (I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been the owner of 4 EVs since 2013 - 2023; a decade). IF U have ANY questions in regards such (driving an EV is different in regards to an ICE vehicle, please feel free to ASK. I might note that I am still an ardent supporter of the Oil & Gas ‚Äö√µŒ©√î‚àè√® industry and there are subtleties U learn in the difference b/t EVs & ICE. Equally, I am also an ardent supporter of EV vehicles, though I will echo Elon musk‚Äö√Ñ√≤s comments in regard to such:

 - From an interview sry late last year.
 
 This is, very much, still, a technology in its infancy, that, & like all forms of transportation, since the horse and buggy, will continue to evolve, though I must admit, I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t mind skipping my gas bill of MANY yrs ago (ESP since last ‚Äö√Ñ√∫ICE‚Äö√Ñ√π vehicle in 2012 was an SUV that ang‚Äö√Ñ√¥d approx 9mpg!).! Anyway, like all technologies, things will evolve, and people still have a lot of questions in regards to the EV industry and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m only happy to answer such questions after a decade of owning/driving exclusively, EV‚Äö√Ñ¬∂half of that decade, owning/driving exclusively multiple Teslas.
 
 Also of NOTE: unfortunately, there are people who, dislike the EV industry, primarily out of fear and misinformation. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s unfortunate as, in all of our lifetimes, ANYbody who is alive today, will ABSOLUTELY NOT be impacted by the EV industry as it pertains to their employment. Those with this mindset might be wise to think Ô£ø√º¬ß√Æ of the analogy of the original fear of automobiles when horse and buggies were the primary mode of transportation; ‚Äö√Ñ√∫fear of [key word: VERY ‚Äö√Ñ√∫EVENTUAL‚Äö√Ñ√π‚Äö√Ñ¬∂NOT ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Overnight] CHANGE,‚Äö√Ñ√π in essence, is what it boils down to. Again, the EV industry will continue to grow, but for anybody alive today, it certainly will not, nay, CANNOT replace the ICE (Ice Internal Combustion engine) anytime soon; so PLEASE ‚Äö√Ñ√∫put away such fears and prejudices; this industry will NEVER impact your livelihood!). Moreover, such ‚Äö√Ñ√∫haters‚Äö√Ñ√π & naysayers should just relax, and understand that technology, no matter what industry it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s applicable to, will continue to evolve like ALL technology has since the dawn of time. I could say much more in regards to this but as this is not the place for such discourse, those that do you have legitimate interests, again, feel free to contact me, and I am more than happy to enlighten anybody about the pros and cons of the fantastic ‚Äö√Ñ√∫EV World‚Äö√Ñ√π and help you to understand the differences as they definitely DO exist. Good day & blessings to all! Take good care! ‚Äö√∫√•Ô£ø√º√®¬∫Ô£ø√º√¥√á"

 This is, very much, still, a technology in its infancy, that, & like all forms of transportation, since the horse and buggy, will continue to evolve, though I must admit, I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t mind skipping my gas bill of MANY yrs ago (ESP since last ‚Äö√Ñ√∫ICE‚Äö√Ñ√π vehicle in 2012 was an SUV that ang‚Äö√Ñ√¥d approx 9mpg!).! Anyway, like all technologies, things will evolve, and people still have a lot of questions in regards to the EV industry and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m only happy to answer such questions after a decade of owning/driving exclusively, EV‚Äö√Ñ¬∂half of that decade, owning/driving exclusively multiple Teslas.
 
 Also of NOTE: unfortunately, there are people who, dislike the EV industry, primarily out of fear and misinformation. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s unfortunate as, in all of our lifetimes, ANYbody who is alive today, will ABSOLUTELY NOT be impacted by the EV industry as it pertains to their employment. Those with this mindset might be wise to think Ô£ø√º¬ß√Æ of the analogy of the original fear of automobiles when horse and buggies were the primary mode of transportation; ‚Äö√Ñ√∫fear of [key word: VERY ‚Äö√Ñ√∫EVENTUAL‚Äö√Ñ√π‚Äö√Ñ¬∂NOT ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Overnight] CHANGE,‚Äö√Ñ√π in essence, is what it boils down to. Again, the EV industry will continue to grow, but for anybody alive today, it certainly will not, nay, CANNOT replace the ICE (Ice Internal Combustion engine) anytime soon; so PLEASE ‚Äö√Ñ√∫put away such fears and prejudices; this industry will NEVER impact your livelihood!). Moreover, such ‚Äö√Ñ√∫haters‚Äö√Ñ√π & naysayers should just relax, and understand that technology, no matter what industry it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s applicable to, will continue to evolve like ALL technology has since the dawn of time. I could say much more in regards to this but as this is not the place for such discourse, those that do you have legitimate interests, again, feel free to contact me, and I am more than happy to enlighten anybody about the pros and cons of the fantastic ‚Äö√Ñ√∫EV World‚Äö√Ñ√π and help you to understand the differences as they definitely DO exist. Good day & blessings to all! Take good care! ‚Äö√∫√•Ô£ø√º√®¬∫Ô£ø√º√¥√á"

Accessibility and Availability,Positive,Fast charging and always availability,"Fast charging and always availability. Right off the interstate. The Quick Pik has been recently remodeled and has new owners. The bathrooms are usually clean and there are normal convenience store items as well as a sit down restaurant which also features Godfather's Pizza. Haven't had a chance to eat here since Covid-19 hit, but when they were located across the street the food was decent and kinda like an old style diner. One of the cool things about this location is there is a park right next to the Superchargers where you can walk, sit and relax or have a picnic. There are several benches and a gazebo to get out of the sun. Grab a few sandwiches and drinks inside and head out to the park for a picnic among the flowers with a great view of the Iowa countryside!"

I was told that no one had ever asked before! As to this Supercharger, the area was clean and the charging time was average. It gave me peace of mind for continuing on my trip!"
Output: Amenities and Location,Positive,Convenient location for Sheetz or McDonalds while you wait.,I was the only car charging here on a Monday afternoon. Convenient location for Sheetz or McDonalds while you wait.
Output 13: Charging speed and efficiency,Positive,very slow (giving me about 200mi,"I was the only person here around 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon. Very clean and nice shopping center.
 
 Update: I returned to this charging station twice yesterday (drove from Knoxville to Nashville and back in one day) and two of the stalls were VERY SLOW (giving me about 200mi/hr of range.) However, the third one I tried on my trip back home to Knoxville was twice as fast, giving me about 400 miles of range per hour. The stall closest to Food Lion was slowest, and the one farthest away was the fastest."

Stations are right by the entrance, in front of the plaza, however in order to get there, you need to make several turns and drive behind building, no directional signs either, so I had to guess at first."
Accessibility and Amenities and location,Positive,"attached to a Hy-Vee that is open 24 hours, great selection and easy access to restrooms, always a few free stalls for charging and they're usually pretty darn fast, surprised to see Green Cab there","I wish this were closer to the interstate, but it's awesome that it's attached to a Hy-Vee that is open 24 hours. The store has a great selection and easy access to restrooms. There are always a few free stalls for charging and they're usually pretty darn fast. Kind of surprised to see Green Cab there, though. I had thought commercial vehicles were not allowed to use Superchargers. I won't complain, since it wasn't near full, though."

Make the extra push to Monroe or just stop in for 5-10 mins. There were several people aimlessly wandering around in the area talking to themselves. It looks like a scene from The Walking Dead.
Output: charging speed and efficiency,Negative,"My charge peaked out around 70kW, which added roughly 20 min to my overall charge time.","I wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t call this a SuperCharger because you don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t get the normal 120kW at a regular SuperCharger. My charge peaked out around 70kW, which added roughly 20 min to my overall charge time.
 
 I missed them the first drive by as I was looking for the bright red lit stalls with Tesla plastered all over them. These stalls don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have anything illuminated on them so they don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t really stand out from the street."
Output: queue and waiting time,Negative,"people take up space and will not move for other Tesla charger, reliability and maintenance",I wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t recommend here people take up space and will not move for other Tesla charger. Also 1/2 of the charger doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t work.
Output: queue and waiting time,Negative,had to wait 30 minutes to charge,I'll give it 5 stars when they open more supercharge stalls. When I went I had to wait 30 minutes to charge which I was not used to and it made me even more mad to see wrapped stalls right next to the chargers.
Accessibility and Accessibility,Negative,"All 6 chargers were open, but I'm only getting 16mi","I'm having a problem supercharging and have to take the car in to Tesla. In order to do so, I need to fully charge (Knoxville to Nashville requires quite a bit of juice). My wall connector is an hour away (at my office in Cleveland), so Tesla recommended I stop by Embassy Suites and use their destination charger. I hesitated because they probably intend for patrons to use them, but Tesla said it shouldn't be a problem, if it's not busy (and I'm not keeping a patron from charging).
 
 All 6 chargers were open, but I'm only getting 16mi/hr of range. The car says I have another 5hr 45min to fully charge. Are you kidding me?! My wall connector gives me close to 50mi/hr. I can't imagine if there were another Tesla or two charging with me. I guess for guests okay with charging overnight, this would be okay. But this is barely useful. (And I'd be happy to pay them for use of an adequate charger)."
Output: Safety,Negative,sits at the top of the parking lot and not where any water pools,I'm just glad this sits at the top of the parking lot and not where any water pools. That's an accident waiting to happen.
Output: Accessibility and Availability,Negative,this charging station doesn't exist,I'm like 90% sure this charging station doesn't exist. Of the countless hours I've spent in town I've never once even seen a glimpse of it.

I noticed neon traffic cones adjacent to the chargers (not in the actual parking space), and the chargers are locked (I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m ok with this, as they have a sign stating, guests are to ask personnel to unlock for charging. Curious why they would have cones stacked and not used, for the apparent purpose of leaving these parking spots vacant. When I called to inquire about my situation, I was told that the cords reach up to four parking spaces. I am not disagreeing with this, as I have not put this to the test, but it seemed within reason, however; all four spots were taken on two occasion, by non-Tesla vehicles (or any EV for that matter). I was also told the hotel was at capacity; at capacity did not seem sufficient enough when there was about 10 parkings available. I get the fact that the parking for destination charging was slightly closer than the vacant parkings, due to all rooms being booked. If people are booking rooms, whether it be personal or business, I would think that those who have limited resources for tier 2 charging in Sierra Vista would get some preference over someone who wants to park 10-20 feet closer to the hotel, when there is a gas station less than a 1/2 mile away.
 
 The individual Monica was very pleasant and understanding on the phone.
 
 Not sure if this hotel gets make and model color when checking in; This could easily remedy the situation by contacting the guests at some point. Using the cones would be my first option though‚Äö√Ñ¬∂"

What the sign does not tell you is how far a walk this is. Let me tell you it is a distance that becomes increasingly more relevant the fuller your bladder is.
 
 Coming from Yosemite the park will be on the right, before you get to the chargers. Coming from the rest of the world, flip and reverse the above.

Just go to the Texas Steakhouse and you'll be fine.

There's a Hobby Lobby across the parking lot (with clean bathrooms) and the Texas Steakhouse has 20% off for Tesla drivers (though I will always prefer Texas Roadhouse instead). My current favorite option is to get something tasty at the Smithfield Chicken and Barbeque accross the street (large restaurant, also clean bathrooms).

 There's plenty of shops in the area to grab a bite, drink, or do some casual shopping. Last few times I stopped by, the McDonald's interior dining area was closed, but there's several small eateries if you want to sit down or use the restroom."

Accessibility and Accessibility,Positive,renovated Sheetz,"My new favorite I-95/US1 Supercharger stop in VA!
 
 For years I'd hit the Sheetz for Food and the Glen Allen Supercharger for fuel, but now I don't have to. There are 8x v3 (250kW / ""Superfast"") charging stalls here at a renovated Sheetz. That means you can stuff your face with all the cheesy, fried, delicious MTO food you're used to while your ride gets a snack of its own. 9 times out of 10, if you order hot food your Tesla is charged enough to get to the next leg of your trip by the time you get it. And as always, the staff here is super friendly and gives you that awesome Sheetz service.
 
 5/5 for clean toilets, a nice fresh renewed look, the new Dolewhip machine! and an easy to pull into charging location away from the crazy traffic of the gas pumps! Also, because the Sheetz is open 24 hours, if you get here late late late at night, you still have toilets available to you (unlike you do at strip mall locations--sorry Glen Allen!)
 
 Tips:
 - Come here for superfast charging and delicious road food to take with you on your drive.
 - Head a few miles south for the Glen Allen Supercharger for sit-down restaurant service and charging at a more relaxed pace (that is less likely to get you overage charges).
 - Best place to evaluate traffic conditions and decide whether you want I-95/I-295 or US1 for the next leg."

Output: Amenities and location,Negative,"no trash cans and window cleaning supplies, limited restroom options",My only complaints is that there are no trash cans and window cleaning supplies like traditionally fuel stations have.

Output 12: reliability and maintenance,Negative,None of the chargers stalls were working,On my way from Toronto to Virginia over the holidays we reached this supercharger based on the navigation direction in my 2018 model x 75D. We reached at a SoC of 9%. None of the chargers stalls were working. Tried all of them but nothing. After multiple chats and calls and hours with Tesla and they suggested third party chargers so went to the closest one available. (In the meantime Tesla has marked the supercharge as ‚Äö√Ñ√∫under planned maintenance‚Äö√Ñ√π for a week.) The ChargePoint charger we went to was a 7 kW charger. After another hour with Tesla to arrange a tow to a faster charger they mentioned that this has to be paid out of pocket and not covered by Tesla. When explained the fact that this was a problem with the supercharger and not the car they mentioned that it might happen that the supercharger would not work at times. Which basically means that the superchargers are unreliable as well and if you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re stuck like us get ready to spend out of your own pocket for a tow. Also after the tow even if you reach the next supercharger there is no guarantee that the super chargers will work. It might be in the same situation as this one ( while on the chat with Tesla they could see that 2 of the stalls were not working but all others were working which was clearly not the case when we reached. There was another model 3 which faced the same issue). Sorry for the long review but be careful specially if you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re traveling with family and small kids in winter.

Output 13: Accessibility and Amenities and location,Negative,There is only one charger suitable for anyone that has anything hitch mounted (hitch rack or trailer).,"Overall a great charging location, super convenient for I-25 and the gas station has Wendy's and good snack options.
 
 One side note: right now there is construction on the south bound I-25 exit and there is almost no signage on where the detour is. Your best bet is to get on I-25 north and get off on the first exit about 2 miles down then cross the bridge and head south. It's absolutely absurd.
 
 Why 3 stars?
 
 Cons:
 There is only one charger suitable for anyone that has anything hitch mounted (hitch rack or trailer). We had a hitch mounted carrier with an ice chest on it, and even backing all the way up against the chargers, the cable didn't reach. So our only options were: park sideways and block a bunch of stalls OR remove the hitch rack. Luckily when we got there nearly all the chargers were empty but right when we finished charging, literally about 8 Teslas pulled in and we looked like the most inconsiderate Tesla owners on the planet for about 5 mins.
 
 Given how quickly stalls filled up, and the limited options for anything hitch mounted, they clearly need more stalls here."

Output: Amenities and Location,Positive,local cafe near the charger,"Pleasantly surprised to find a local cafe near the charger! Almost exclusively over the past 3 weeks traveling from charger to charger I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been disappointed to wait in a hotel parking lot or other plaza, nowhere near real food (I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m looking at you too Applebees). The drought ended today with the pleasant soup/sandwich and ice cream offerings at the delightful U Drop Inn cafe! Others have pointed out that there is an 24 hour outdoor restroom open if you happen to come when the cafe is closed. How nice! This type of experience is what I expected charging would be like but not so at other places. This place is the pleasant exception and not the rule. Usually one finds herself in a dirty parking lot without so much as a trash can. Thanks for doing it right, Shamrock!
 
 I should probably mention that the charging seemed to be perfectly fine, but honestly it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not the headline. Get some real food, rest a spell, and appreciate how clean everything is."

Review 13: [Stayed at the Quality Inn on 3,25,"23 on our way back to L.A.. Super convenient to have the Tesla Superchargers across from our room. The Tesla map says the superchargers are offline, but called the manager to confirm they are in fact working. We actually skipped this location and used the Electrify America charger on our way to Austin because we saw that it was offline. So glad we got a chance to stay at the hotel and use the supercharger. Please be nice to the manager and mindful of your trash. The manager is super nice and he's had some encounters with really rude Tesla owners. Let's all be better and courteous to the hotel locations. They try and accommodate travelers with their restroom facilities and try to provide vending services with food and drinks. Also note that if you travel during the late night early morning hours they do close their lobby for safety purposes. Great stay and awesome convenient charging location.]","Stayed at the Quality Inn on 3/25/23 on our way back to L.A.. Super convenient to have the Tesla Superchargers across from our room.

We stopped here mid morning to find an oversized RV towing a small pickup truck blocking all but two of the stalls. The restaurant manager left an overly polite note on the RV letting them know that they ""next time"" they should park over on the side of the building, and that these spots were reserved. The manager said that no one in the restaurant acknowledged that it was their RV. She said she called the police ""non-emergency line"" to report it. When I called the police, and asked to have it towed, they said they couldn't tow it without the business owner's permission. The police told me that they had no record of the restaurant manager having called. I'm thinking that if that RV had blocked the front door of the restaurant, that manager might have been more proactive.

 Speaking of toilets, that's my only real CON about this place. The toilets were terrible the last time I stopped here. Even if they were to be freshly serviced, the bathroom itself feels like it'll never be that be clean (or dry). On the other hand, it looks like there are showers available if you ask. I've definitely stopped at more welcoming Stuckey's though. PROs? Cheap candy, and Stealth Bombers to keep you occupied (if you're not driving)."

Output 13: reliability and maintenance,Negative,Neither of the 2 Tesla chargers worked,"This is the only Tesla charging available in hundred miles radius and it didn't work for me during the Labor Day weekend (2020). I left supercharger at Burlington, WA with full charge (280 miles worth), Winthrop is 140 miles one-way, so it was a tight roundtrip with no room for error; so I visited this destination charger hoping to add 30 miles for safety. Neither of the 2 Tesla chargers worked (the charging port glowed red, and the panel said 'charging equipment fault'). The faculty at the lodge tried to reset the chargers a couple of times, but that didn't change anything.
 
 First, the destination chargers are at the top of a mountain that's 12 miles from Winthrop, but takes 25 miles worth of battery to reach from Winthrop -- so, when you go there and the charger doesn't work, you've now wasted 25-30 miles of battery to make that trip up the hill and in vain. No one at the lodge can tell you either upfront if the chargers work or otherwise -- they won't know.
 
 There's a third non-Tesla charger; but beware it's a 30A charger, which will charge about 17miles per hour at best.
 
 I suggest - don't bother with this charging option unless you have a 10kWh buffer to gamble with. Instead, your best bets are some of the camping grounds (KOA for example) that lets you use 50A plugs for 5-6 hours in RV camping slots for $20 or so (of course you'd need your charging cable & adapters). In fact, the entire SR-20 stretch is a terrible idea with a Tesla right now -- until Tesla installs a supercharger in Winthrop. Hope they do soon -- it's one of the popular routes for camping/vacationing."

Inside the store there are ample drink and snack options for a long road trip. The chargers are in very good shape. I've never had a problem with a charger here not working or a cracked charge plug.
 
 There are other chargers for electrics that don't use the Tesla plug nearby. If Tesla opens the Supercharger network to all electrics in the US I doubt it will affect the capacity at this Supercharger for Tesla vehicles. This will keep this station relevant for years to come."

Many Tesla owners might be surprised to be stopping at a Food Lion to plug in, but if you get past pre-conceptions, you'll find 12x fast (250kW) chargers here, and very friendly staff at the grocery store (we had one cashier very nicely ask us the usual questions about how long to charge, what's it like to drive, etc.) Bonus #1, the bathrooms at the Food Lion were super clean and well maintained. Bonus #2, being a grocery store, there's no shortage of snacks you can pick up here, plus they have Dunkin mochaccinos! #3 The Superchargers are in a less-usual, pull through configuration AND they're angle parking. That makes for a different look on your Instagram or something if you just have to share. Bonus #4: Trash and recycling are in easy reach at the storefronts. Bonus #5 The road is quiet enough you can easily walk to the KFC, Subway, McDonalds or Pizza Hut across the street. You're not hurting for choice here, as long as you arrive during store hours.

Output 15: Safety,Positive,The location otherwise at 9pm is well lit and doesn't seem unsafe,"UPDATE: 10/17 Ok. Location has gotten worse. Charge speed was 54kWh and one charger out of commission. You have to talk to the hotel for the bathroom and restaurant was closed until 5pm at the Hilton. Personally I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d avoid this place going forward on my trips from AZ to CA. Sorry but I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not taking the 3:10 to Yuma anymore. Ô£ø√º√≤√¢

Compatibility and Connectivity,Negative,their charging station didnt work with newer models (ours was a 2019 Model S),"We tried stopping by the tesla charging destination at rock fish. The food was good, but the charging station didnt work. The manager at the restauarant said their charging station didnt work with newer models (ours was a 2019 Model S). They tried restarting the station, but it didnt work. We tried one last time after dinner and it still didnt work. I am not sure why but it might work for older models, but definetly not for newer models. Pretty disappointed. (FYI we visited september 2020)."
