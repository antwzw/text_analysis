Frustrating as hell! Most of them require a 2nd or 3rd try to get the charger to work. This must improve!!!

"Very busy, but the only Supercharger in town. The app reported it was closed, but there are only a couple being serviced by Tesla while we are charging. 10 minutes to Starbucks so easy walk while you charge."

"Ok, 3a wasn't working well for me. It stopped charging several times. Even after unplug and replug. Tried another and it was fine. Got 145kw. Pretty busy. Bathroom is in basement of hotel btw."

Great location! It's just off the freeway behind Oxford Suites. There are a couple restaurants right next to it but if you walk South and cross overland you will find better options. There's a small patch of grass where you can let your dog out and stretch their legs. And a restroom downstairs in the hotel or walk over to Lowe's.

Supercharger is in the Oxford Suites hotel parking lot. The side door closest to the charger may be locked so I had to go through the front door and walk by the front desk liked I owned the place lol. Bathrooms are not on the ground floor. Stairs were "blocked" to get to the basement where the bathroom is. So taking the elevator just past the front desk might be the better option. Ice machine on the first floor was helpful for me.

"What an electrifying spot! Not only do you get the stellar vibes from the campus, but you get to juice your vehicle up too! Great access and gives you plenty to look at while you wait! 10 out of 10 electric vehicle drivers give this 5 stars!"

Very fast charge for my chevy volt
Impossible to overstate the magnitude of positive impact these two charging stations have had in my travels. They've definitely been a Godsend in the past & today proves they're worthy of top spot for being there ready to serve up electrons without any hassle & for giving my battery what it needs to move the car going forward.

This Chargepoint location is simply awesome! If you stop by during business hours you can sit in their lobby area and they also have a nice clean restroom you can use as well while you wait for you vehicle to charge. e-470 is very generous in providing a DC fast charge location at no cost to the user.

So far no problems charging here
Only one charger works here at the e470 toll authority. Also it suspends mid charge for no reason.

Station KEIFER is broken and will not start a charging session with the vehicle. Still charges your card $4. Be wary.

"Edit: as a follow-up, have contacted EVGo who refused to refund the session charge. Changing my review to 1 star. Terrible customer service."

"The charging station is great but the Walmart has so many things on lockdown inside, and is so concerned about people ripping them off, that you get the feeling that you are in one of the most unsafe areas I have ever been in. I would say that this charging station gets honorable mention for at least being there but be careful, I’m not sure about leaving your $80,000 electric vehicle outside of that Walmart! Inside the store, you got a feeling of fear and that there could be violence at any moment. I think Walmart should shut the store down."

If there were car vacuums and trash cans on site it sure would make charging very efficient.

New EV in the family now and was best decision I have made. Evgo is convenient and numerous around the city. Use the app opens new areas and van filter easier by your specific connector. I have a chademo connector for fast charging and takes about an hour. I walk the dog and grab a drink. Has cut my gas bill more than half

Is anyone going to fix this station? There's only one available. Is been months. I get the feeling nobody cares.
Please fix it. It makes the app more worth it for me and a bunch of more ev drives.

I’d advise anybody to go elsewhere than here. There’s a bunch of EV stations around that are both EVGo and not-EVGo

Last time I tried to use it I was stuck latched on for 30+ minutes while I waited on hold for CS to reboot the machine - I couldn’t even get it charging.

I went one machine over and I successfully started charging but the “end session” button wouldn’t select. Spent another 25+ minutes waiting for CS to manually end the session and refund my money that was over charged (they didn’t).
I’d advise anybody to go elsewhere than here. There’s a bunch of EV stations around that are both EVGo and not-EVGo

Four Good chargers. At least one charge cable is on the short side. I had to reposition the car to plug in.

This location is the worst! The parking lot is always full because it’s inside the lot of the hotel. Very busy since it’s the closest location to DIA. It’s also filthy here. The parking spots always have trash and spilled food or drinks. The charging is also very slow here no matter the stall. Do better Tesla.

"This supercharger was a lifesaver after being parked at the airport for a week in cold weather (I think we arrived at the charger with 3%). Based on other reviews, I was a little worried about slow charging speeds but I got ~140kw the entire time, even with 3-4 other cars there."

We had a hitch mounted carrier and were able to back in and still reach the charging cable. There were two chargers that you could use even if you had a trailer attached.
"Also, the hotel attendant didn't even question us when we went inside looking for restrooms."

"So I think overall a good spot. As always, more amenities like food/snacks would be better, but I think from a family perspective this one is pretty great. I could imagine even letting kids run around inside the hotel lobby on bad weather days."

There are also other chargers with different plug-ins, I’m not sure what kind, I haven’t checked it out."

Two of the four chargers were not working. Only chargers -03 and -04 were working in January 2023.

We had the same experience at this location 6 months ago. It's our least favorite Electrify America location due to the poor reliability here. We call each time and they say they'll put in a ticket. Today we were waiting behind 3 other vehicles waiting to charge and it added nearly two hours to our trip.

"They have upgraded this place, so it works a lot better than the old units. I'm giving it 4 stars only because it worked at the time I was there. Unfortunately, Electrify America is the only game in town as far as fast chargers go, so we don't really have a choice. Hopefully, as the infrastructure gets better, the service will get better. As for now, this is all we have. When using any Electrify Americas, you should check ahead of time to make sure the units are going to be up and running on your route or you're wind up getting stuck. Electrify America is not the most reliable charging company in the world, but it's all we have."

"Only charged 70 kWh at the very beginning, even with preconditioning the battery, instead of the listed 250; this is due to the electric bank the chargers are connected to being 20-50ft away across the street and a row of parking in between as well. The closer the electric bank is to the superchargers, the more likely of the listed kWh being correct. Appreciated Whole Foods and REI being nearby."

Closed as of 2/12/2023 noon. Tesla didn’t indicate this until we reached this supercharger. Please check before planning on charging here.
I've never had to wait for a charging spot! It's nice and convenient.

Great spot with plenty of chargers. At 11am on a Sunday 4/8 chargers were occupied. There were no squatters as EA will charge you for going over 10min of sitting. Overall great charging just wish Walmart had more restaurant-food options.

Electrify America continues to be one of the most reliable charging networks outside of the Tesla charging Network. I wish they would have more DC fast charging stations at more Targets and Walmarts. It would go a long way to making adoption of electric cars accelerate.

Easy to locate. Works at the speed on the charger. We used the 150 kWh charger today since the 350 kWh charger were in use.

4 total spots. 2 of them broken. 350 charges at 67kw rate. Luckily the 150 charged at 160kw rate. The Sheetz is sketch. I would recommend not adding this charge to your route. Go to Henderson Walmart are charger instead.

Update Jan 2023 - downgraded to one star. this is second time it is happening. The charging starts and abruptly stops for no reason. The 350KW are slower than 150 KW.

Old review - Good spot... Two spots with 350 kw and two spots with 150 KW. Would be great if there could be a crosswalk with the nearby shopping mall.
update Nov 20 - The stations weren't working. Had to call the customer service to get the charging station working. Reducting the starts to 3 from 5

Problem is that there are lots of chargers but only one is the Chademo that I need. The Nissan Leaf also takes this connection so I had to wait for 20 minutes for it to be free. Meanwhile there were 20 or so unused chargers available. Maybe better to have a more equal number? Or even 2 it 3 Chademo?

"This charging station is fairly conveniently located. It's within a parking area for Bank of America, but it's not limited to customer parking. This might be a spot where if you wanted to charge and grab a quick bite nearby, you could, but I generally haven't done that myself. This charging station is generally reliable, although I have had issues a few times where I've had to contact customer support to get going — although to be fair, that's not necessarily an issue isolated to this charging station."

This is the worst EA charger. It constantly has one or two chargers (out of 3) not working and there are long lines of cars waiting to charge.

"Middle charger worked well. The one closest to the bank did not work at all. The charger farthest from the bank delivered at a lousy 27kwh rate, practically wasting the time and travel used to charge."

Just avoid Berkeley EVgo stations entirely. It's a miracle if the charger isn't down. EA stations in Emeryville are busy but they actually work.

Great to have 4 more charging stations! Placement of them is pretty strange though.

The chargers are either always in use or have malfunctions. Last time my car only charged for 7 minutes before the charging station said something about a fatal flaw in the charger. I've never had a smooth experience charging my car here.

"They are way near the front, so you have to crawl slowly through the BUSIEST Walmart parking lot I have ever been in."

And they aren’t even near each other so if one is not working for you you have to crawl across the lot to get to the others

I will avoid this one in the future

This is not a safe area. I would never let my wife charge her Tesla/EV at night here. During the day it might be okay. This part of Oakland is the straight up hood. Please Tesla —- find a new location closer to the 580 freeway. Anything along the 880 freeway is not a safe place.

Update 4/27/22: had to walk up the on-ramp just to get back inside the garage to return to my car because the doors are locked and the ticket readers at the doors don’t work. Also the pay station on the ground floor doesn’t work so you have to walk up the on-ramp to the 3rd floor pay stations to pay. End result being I was charged for an extra hour because of the time I spent trying to get to my car (the “push for assistance button” also didn’t work and the office was empty). $4 for parking just to charge my Tesla on a slow charger and still pay the charging fees as well. Why can’t you rate as zero stars??

Original post: Parking garage is not open 24 hours and does not seem to even follow it’s own listed hours. I’ve arrived as early as 4 pm to find the gate already down. What a waste of time. Elon should definitely open one somewhere else in Oakland cause this is ridiculous.
Update 4/27/22: had to walk up the on-ramp just to get back inside the garage to return to my car because the doors are locked and the ticket readers at the doors don’t work. Also the pay station on the ground floor doesn’t work so you have to walk up the on-ramp to the 3rd floor pay stations to pay.

"Charging station located right off the 880 freeway. Easy access on your way to/from SFO or heading up to Sacramento. There are ample shops nearby while you wait for your Tesla to charge. Located right next to the Marshalls and Trader Joe’s, you can shop while you wait or walk over to Bay Street which is about a 7 minute walk."

"Weekends during the day are pretty busy but come during the week, evening or during the day and you’re bound to find a place to charge. This station has 18 charging points available 24/7."

"This Supercharger Station happens to be one of the closest to my apartment (so I may be biased). However, it's conveniently located next to several shopping marts, which includes, Ross, Marshalls, Traders Joe's and Banana Republic. It's also about a 7 minute walk from Emeryville Bay Street which also has places for you to shop. I usually come to this spot after 7pm and generally can find a spot available. There's only been one time (my first time charging my Tesla) that I had to wait for a stall to open. All in all I love the location and quickness of the charges. I highly recommend utilizing this station as a ""get some errands done"" station."

"As a local Emeryville resident, charging here was AMAZING before the Bay became over saturated with Teslas. I only charge during off peak hours, usually a rate of $.23 kWh but has been $.45 - $.48 kWh for at least a month now!! Heads up, Tesla informed me that the Emeryville locations DOES NOT OFFER OFF PEAK HOURS/RATES anymore!! It was good before it lasted, I guess no more super early morning/late night charging sessions for me, for now."

"Located on the side parking lot of Marshalls in a well lit place. There were plenty of shops around if you didn't feel like waiting in the car. Due to the number of homeless people around, this part of Emeryville can be a little sketchy. But I did see the police patrolling the area."

"Update: drove through a Saturday July 16 2022, late morning, and 3/6 chargers were down, causing a backup of 3 cars lined up waiting for a charge. One of the other drivers was on the phone with EA while we were there, and was told they were sending someone right out. However, on my return trip we stopped by Sunday afternoon, 3 chargers were still offline, again cars waiting. With it being such a high traffic stop, at least on the weekends due to it's proximity to 87/90, it was disappointing they didn't have the chargers back online the next day. It's still a good spot to charge, with convenience of Walmart and Panera right there, so hopefully they get it back in working order or open more stations in the area."

"//June 2022: Worked exactly as expected. MachE connected as soon as it was plugged in and charge speed as anticipated. 4-5 chargers in use while we were stopped, with folks coming and going. All chargers were working when we stopped, June 2022. Located off to the side of the Walmart entrance, not a far walk. Convenient to 90 and able to run into the Walmart for bathroom, etc."

Update 10/2022: way less busy passing through this weekend. Pulled right up and charged. All appeared to be working.

"Update: drove through a Saturday July 16 2022, late morning, and 3/6 chargers were down, causing a backup of 3 cars lined up waiting for a charge. One of the other drivers was on the phone with EA while we were there, and was told they were sending someone right out. However, on my return trip we stopped by Sunday afternoon, 3 chargers were still offline, again cars waiting. With it being such a high traffic stop, at least on the weekends due to it's proximity to 87/90, it was disappointing they didn't have the chargers back online the next day. It's still a good spot to charge, with convenience of Walmart and Panera right there, so hopefully they get it back in working order or open more stations in the area."

"//June 2022: Worked exactly as expected. MachE connected as soon as it was plugged in and charge speed as anticipated. 4-5 chargers in use while we were stopped, with folks coming and going.

"Recently I swapped out the engine and electrical system of my AMC Gremlin with that of a Tesla Model S Performance. You may be asking why. It’s because I’m just a humble person who doesn’t like to flaunt his ridiculous wealth. When people see the Gremlin exterior, they assume it’s powered by a straight 252 engine with 200hp and not a vehicle that offers a “Ludicrous Mode” of 0-60 in 2.4 seconds. Also, gasoline is expensive and I hate purchasing it."
"Regardless, this specific charging station charges my Gremlin fully and satisfactorily. As an added bonus, it is all the way up in Alaska, so I get a nice long drive up from my home near the world famous Clown Motel at 521 N Main St, Tonopah, NV whenever I need a charge. Totally worth it."

In almost 3 years with my Model 3 this was the WORST Supercharging experience I have had. I use Superchargers to charge fast and be on my way during long trips. This charger has the following PROBLEMS for me:
1. It is too far from Route 50 and you have to go through city traffic to get to and from it.
"2. It is in a parking garage across the street from a Target and people go there, plug in and LEAVE to go shopping. I got the last space."
3. To use a bathroom you have to go down 2 levels from the garage and up two levels into the Target.
There is a better charger on Kent Island that is far superior which I will review.

"Charging stations work well initially until a massive drop on a 150 kW charger to 40 kW at 34% SoC.It's not the most ideal location. Massive containers filled most of the parking lot making it a bit tricky to navigate. Luckily, there are a few ways into the lot."

First time since 2020 needing to use a public charger because I usually just charge at home while we sleep. Got a free charge here when I needed it with no waiting. Been gas-free since 2018 and never going back!

"4 units on site with 6 CCS and 2 CHAdeMO chargers that range in output from 100kw to 350kw. It appears that if you don't have a EVgo account set up it costs $3 to connect and about $0.30 per minute to charge. EVgo reserves $30 on your card before charging and it appears to take awhile before it changes to the correct amount. Overall not a bad system, hope to see more stations installed in Minnesota."

"It's a Supercharger. Not much to say. Although my GPS took me to the front of Hy-Vee when the Supercharger is in the back, it's parallel to the Starbucks drive thru. Hy-Vee has their own electric chargers but you don't wanna use that for your Tesla when the Supercharger is right there. I believe there are 8 superchargers here so definitely a lot for now and you probably won't be waiting."

There's finally a second supercharger in the Minneapolis area! There are 8 spots and I was able to get 147kW on my model 3 which is a great charging speed. This location also has a window cleaning station and trash can. The chargers that are at Hy-Vee's are always convenient because you can go in and grab a couple snacks while you're waiting.

"So grateful for this charging station! I'm borrowing my mom's electric car (so not something I need to find often) and I don't usual go to this part of town. The first charging station I found (competing company) was awful awful. It was hidden in the underground level of a parking lot, way back in the corner. Super creepy to be down there alone at night. And then it didn't work. It didn't have any reviews on Google but within the company app, it had lots of reviews with the same complaint. There were two others belonging to that company with similarly terrible locations and reviews. And then this one. Right off the freeway. Easy to find. Very easy to see glowing green station. Where lots of people could see me so I felt safe but not in a crowded area, off to the side of the parking lot. Not only did it work, I was 50% charged in 15 minutes for a couple dollars! I will definitely be using Electrify America stations (I hope there are more, I haven't looked yet)."

The first charging station I found (competing company) was awful awful. It was hidden in the underground level of a parking lot, way back in the corner. Super creepy to be down there alone at night. And then it didn't work. It didn't have any reviews on Google but within the company app, it had lots of reviews with the same complaint. There were two others belonging to that company with similarly terrible locations and reviews. And then this one. Right off the freeway. Easy to find. Very easy to see glowing green station. Where lots of people could see me so I felt safe but not in a crowded area, off to the side of the parking lot. Not only did it work, I was 50% charged in 15 minutes for a couple dollars! I will definitely be using Electrify America stations (I hope there are more, I haven't looked yet)."

These charging stations are gorgeous. Its quite thrilling to be among the first drivers that are allowed to park next to them. Like having a "back stage pass" to the future of fueling.

They don't seem to mind my lack of skill when it comes to taking advantage of remarkably stunning technology unlike my mobile phone. No worries for me though cuz you don't need any special training with these Volta EV Charging stations it is literally plug and play. If only all of my baytery operated tech were the same I might have mote time to get up to speed or at least a fighting chance at keeping up with the future.

They really are remarkably futuristic in appearance. I love having them on the scene. It just makes me happy to be alive & I take great pleasure parking next to them.

It is an honor to bear witness to their birth and to be one of the first to adopt the technology that makes them possible.

"Not my favorite stop to charge but it’s very convenient off i25 so I come here often. Warning*** there is nothing near the chargers as far as food or restrooms. There are plenty of stalls and never seen it crowded and I typically get 250kw. Also this site is a fixed higher rate to charge, not a surprised because of its location."

"WAS NOT OPERATIONAL AS OF 23 Aug 2022. Not sure if they have since gotten it back up and running. At that time, all chargers at this location were presently totally shut off, with many not even fully assembled, with plastic wrapping still on many of them. The parking spots for every station were blocked off with orange cones."

"Google Assistant/Maps in my Volvo brought me here claiming the chargers were open. Google Maps' regular internet-facing version also indicated they were here and functioning. However, they're not."

I called Electrify America who verified the "outage." I wish they'd taken responsibility for coordinating their database with Google and with Volvo. Both Google Maps on the internet as well as the Volvo in-car version of Maps and the Google Assistant indicated this location was in service.

This inability of Google and EV charging stations to keep each other up-to-date on stuff like this is a serious issue that could easily lead to families getting stranded in god-knows-where. It's not acceptable.

There are a lot of charging stations available but I have had so many issues here with so many stations. I've called all the defective ones in but it doesn't help me when I need a charge... a super plus is that Target is right there when a charger is working and doesn't stop charging after only a few mins.

"Came here on a weekday morning and almost all the slots were open. Wanted to charge from 45% to 100% for a road trip, and was ready to go in less than an hour. Whole Foods has a validation device at their entrance/exit that you can just scan your parking ticket at (for up to 2hr free). I needed to get something anyway but no whole food receipt was required I think."

"The chargers are in the parking garage on the P2 level, which is paid public parking (see photo for pricing) mixed with resident parking for the Waycroft apartments. Residents and visitors are notorious for leaving their vehicles (electric or otherwise) idling in these charging spots overnight, so don't rely on the ""available chargers"" data from Google. LAZ Parking leaves warnings on these vehicles, but doesn't appear to be towing them."

"When entering the garage, don't enter the first gates you see; instead, follow signs for Resident Parking / Vehicle Return to find the P2 gate. After entering the P2 gate, turn left, following the sign for Resident Parking. As mentioned before, P2 is resident parking AND paid public parking. P3 is strictly for residents only, and is gated separately."

"Chargers are marked by green parking spaces. There are 3 of them to your right as soon as you enter P2, and 4 more near the Waycroft elevators further back."

"Remember to lock your vehicle. I've heard of multiple thefts in this garage, and have personally caught a thief on camera on the P2 level in the wee hours of the morning stealing from unlocked vehicles. I wouldn't leave my car plugged in here overnight unless there aren't any other options."

"A Female driver purposely holds two supercharging stations forcing drivers to wait for available one deliberately and dangerously. When she was asked to move her car in designated parking charg station, she refused and returns back to her vehicle. I was forced to squeeze in between hers and another Tesla in order to park and charge my vehicle. This kind of behavior should not be tolerated by Tesla because it is not fair one individual to hold two charging spot while other drivers are waiting for available charging stations."

Tesla supercharger here was great. No problems or wait. Wish they had others South and East of downtown. Starbucks and Quaker steak are walkable food options. 2 trips there and we've done both.

"Ok charger, a little hard to find (behind the hotel). Food nearby is a Starbucks, a Sports Bar (decent food, but closed Monday and Tuesday), The Turn Club, and a block west, Avor Thai, an excellent little Thai restaurant just on the other side of Commonwealth."

"Chargers are on the back corner of the Hyundai dealership. Accessible even when the dealership is closed. There are two stations with two types of chargers each, machines look brand new, clean, quiet, and most importantly they work."

"Downloaded the app to charge my Tesla. Searched and found the station I was at and it confirmed it had the proper connector and said it was good to go. Signed up for an account, added my credit card info, got out and connected the car only to get error message after error message that this particular charging station was not working. So frustrating to go through all of that for no reason. Immediately requested an account deletion."

It took 2 or 3 times to get it to start working. Which I didn’t find out until after I burned some time inside the DD. I would suggest making sure it has initiated fully before walking away. Performed as expected once it was working!

"The first I tried didn't work - the second station charged the car quickly. The charging station does get busy, there are constantly cars pulling in and out, so watch out for idling charges. Great location next to the shops - made the best of our wait."

This is one of the few area Chargers that actually has some shopping in walking distance however there are only eight Chargers and two to three of them are completely broken and have been for months. Please fix them as the place is always crowded and you usually have to wait

"Located in the back of the Hidden Sands Brewing Company. Pretty nice spot only 2 chargers though. Never had a problem charging here. The chargers take about 30 minutes to 80% depending on how low you are. If they put more chargers here it would be great, bc one time 3 cars showed up to charge at the same time and they had to wait."

The charger works great. However it's only 1 station so if there is someone already charging you have to wait until they're done. They do have both Chademo and CCS which is great for different types of EVs. There is nothing to do nearby so you're best bet is to just wait with your car while it charges. Price is a little high but not crazy. Overall it's a great option in a pinch especially considering there are no other DC Fast level 3 chargers in the area other than Tesla.

"The chargers are accessible via the hotels Valet parking. $10 until 6am. I had to pay 20 to charge from 6pm to 730am. It saved me as the rental car company gave me a car that was not fully charged, but after 12 hours on the charger it only had a range of 41 miles so must be a slower charger. That was up from almost dead. Update: although I never saw the charger station my guess it was a Tesla only charger, after going both to a tesla and Charge Point super charger in Egg Harbor I found out Hertz did not provide a Tesla adapter and only had 220 and 110 adapters. The ChargePoint station charged to 100% in two hours for $20 and plugged directly into the Chevy Bolt. That station is a single charger behind hidden sands brewery. You do need their app to pay and start and stop."

Update: although I never saw the charger station my guess it was a Tesla only charger, after going both to a tesla and Charge Point super charger in Egg Harbor I found out Hertz did not provide a Tesla adapter and only had 220 and 110 adapters. The ChargePoint station charged to 100% in two hours for $20 and plugged directly into the Chevy Bolt. That station is a single charger behind hidden sands brewery. You do need their app to pay and start and stop."
Ocean Resort Casino valet staff said they do Not have a charging station.

This Wawa supercharging location is incredibly convenient located just off the Garden State Parkway. However when this parking lot gets busy it becomes extremely dangerous as there isn’t a whole lot of room to navigate.

"The charging stations near the Cross Keys Target are always working and usually available. The area is clean and feels safe. I make a bi-weekly Target shopping trip just to go to this charging station. There's also a Five Guys, Wawa, Lowes, Chick-fil-A, PetsMart and Planet Fitness (although you'll have to do just a little bit of walking for the latter four). The gym is also a good option if you need to charge your vehicle for an hour or so."

Took me a while to actually find the supercharger. To save everyone time it’s inside the parking garage on the 3rd I believe. It has a nice grocery store with elevators so you could do a grocery run. Stays nice and lit up over night but for visibility and ease of access I can’t give this more than 3 stars

Many Tesla chargers at the parking area near Mashpee CVS.
Plenty of working Tesla superchargers 24/7
Nice shopping area where supercharger station is located.
Nice shopping area where supercharger station is located.
Address is not correct. Go to the parking lot directly left of the CVS pharmacy at Mashpee Commons.
Superchargers are at the end of the lot with a Dunkin Donuts and separated with landscaping. The chargers face an open field and are separated from the chargers with concert barriers limiting the turnaround space. Definitely an area you would not want to take a trailer.

It’s really dark and freaky her at night.

This place is kind of hidden and many times it’s does not come up on the map as a choice. About 5 miles away there is a really great smoothie and açaí bowl place called Blended Berry.

"I evaluate supercharged not only on the charging, but availability of bathroom and snacks near by. This location is perfect as it is located next to dunkin donuts just before the sygamore bridge. All we need in one location."
"This Supercharger site really needs some TLC. It's hidden away and set in the absolute pitch dark! No overhead lights or lights on the charging station itself, aside from the dim Tesla Red glow."
I did not feel safe AT ALL at this location.

"Worst charging location I’ve encountered. Too bad because it’s convenient for me. Most often chargers are down hard and when they do work they only deliver 60-70kwh. My car can take 350. I plugged into a 350 and only got 43kwh and I’m the only one here. Awful. EA kinda sucks at this. Come on Tesla, open your US network and put these clowns at EA out of business."

We had to switch chargers because the one we started with was out of order. But once we moved it was a great experience.

Took way too long to get 1 charger out of 8 going but eventually I was able to charge with the touchscreen instead of the app. Got the feeling these don't get much use since a frog hopped out to help.

Located conveniently off of I10. Able to drive direct from Birmingham AL in MS refresh long range. Plenty of food places nearby.

"Not much here but the main thing is it charged us up to continue our journey! No bathroom or stores nearby. Parking is kinda weird. You have to pull in more than I like so be aware not to mess up your bumper- overall a B score. Would only come if needed, else I would pass this one. We came from Seacrest Florida where there are no other superchargers other than Panama City Beach."

"This is a great place to do a longer time charge! They have added a nice map of the little downtown area with places to shop, walk and rest. Stopped at Perla Baking Co. for coffee and took a walk near the lake."

"Farther off I-10 than most superchargers so not the most convenient for roadtrips. Also, I don’t recommend going here at night. Has this eerily quiet and creepy feeling. Random cars kept pulling into the gym parking lot even though the gym was closed and the people never got out of their car. If you can make it to Crestview, that one is way better."

It gets the job done for charging your car. There is some stuff close by but still wished EVs would get a proper rest area and service plaza.

Well it’s a quick charge but nothing much else. No restroom or dining options in the immediate vicinity except a portable potty across the street. At a couple miles off I-10 it’s kind of a random place for a charger.

"The most unreliable charging station I've encountered in Florida. Electrify America will not fix the 2 broken chargers and the ""working"" chargers are offline most of the time. Electrify America should be embarrassed by this, especially since it's right next to a Tesla supercharging station that is always humming."

Set up on the 350 charger. Went to sandwich shop in the parking lot for a fast bite. In twenty mins I added about 80 miles to my battery. Charge with tax was about $7.00. Much more than charging at home but alot better than gasoline. B =)

"Variety of fast food restaurants nearby, grocery store across the parking lot, hospital across the street. Very walkable location. Trash cans on sight. 10/10. This will definitely be a routine stop for me when I'm in South Alabama. This charger was much-needed!"

"A nice supercharger in the parking lot of Winn Dixie, restrooms are in the back right corner. A couple of trashcans to keep the place tidy which is a plus. A few places to eat within the same parking lot, Checkers, Burger King, and Hungry Howie's, but Checkers was drive thru only. If you want to walk across the street there are a few more options."

I was staying at the Microtel due to the train derailment and being displaced from my home. They must have saw I was using the charger(that is advertised as being 24/7) and turned it off. I was moving my car every morning before they opened. When I bought my car i was GUARANTEED I could use all the Nissan charging stations. Absolutely ridiculous and selfish.

"Charger setup is excellent, but ICE cars are constantly parked in front of charger, making it useless. Plenty of parking available so why park in front of it, it appears the cars parked there belong to the workers."

Electrify America has become the only charging station I trust for a long trip. If they don’t have an Electrify America on my route I’m going to take my gas powered vehicle.

I’ve been stranded a few times because I get to a charging station and it’s out of service so there’s nothing better than pulling up to Electrify America seeing 8+ available charging spots!

"The charge is fast, the pricing is great, and they’re always next to a shopping area giving you something to do while your vehicle charges."

"*In this case we are right next to a premium outlet mall and then block away coffee shops, grocery stores, clothing stores etc*"

"Tried two different chargers. First one, #8, gave a red light immediately. Had to call their customer service to get the charger to be released from the port. They asked me to try the #1 station. Plugged into it... And it charged for about 3 seconds then said there was a technical issue. Would not release. Perhaps they need to send a technician out to give the chargers a once over. I have no issues charging at home."

Worst charging station network. I received 2-year free charging from Mercedes-Benz but every time I plug in the charger it says connecting to the vehicle forever and never starts charging unless I reach out to a customer care rep and they get approval to remote start it and then do a remote start. This whole process takes up to 30 mins by which I’d have charged my car.

but the charger is breaking apart: the prongs are all messed up almost bent my car port and plus the charge is slow* (not a super charger). Only one available and would've taken 5 hours to gain 60% charge. I drove the hour to Waco and got free coffee while I shopped... #Better

Looked extremely futuristic and fun. Seems like a great idea. Charge your vehicle while you shop. No exhaust. No oil on the ground. Got to see car take off after charging. Thinking they will have the stations upgraded to where they are covered and secured in the future.

"My go-to Supercharger when visiting the Round Rock area. It's a little hard to get into with the construction, but that will clear soon. It's located between the McDonald's, Cold Stone Creamery, and Freddy's Custard. There are 16 spots that charge up to 250kW. I've come here several times and it's usually no more than 50-75% full and have always had fast, consistent charging speeds."

"There's plenty of shops in the area to grab a bite, drink, or do some casual shopping. Last few times I stopped by, the McDonald's interior dining area was closed, but there's several small eateries if you want to sit down or use the restroom."

Great place to charge your tesla. While also going to the store and getting your groceries. The only downfall is they need to put more in. Because It tends to get filled up fast over the weekend with longer waiting times.

This place often has lines now its so busy. And there's 1 parking spot in the line up that doesn't actually have a charger assigned to it so people reverse into it and immediately switch spots.

This location got one L2 and L3 charger. L3 gives you up to 50 kWh.

L2 is free
L3 is free for first 30 minutes and afterwards $.37 cents.

This one is next to Aldi/Amazon Fresh (yet to open) so you can do your grocery run while car get charged up. I was using $249 CCS adapter from tesla site to fuel up.

Hope this helps.

I'm grateful there is a level 3 charging station in my neighborhood but there is always a stall or two out of order. I wish this station were more reliable.

Charging is capped at 70-75W. Other than that it works. Sometimes.

The thing I don't understand with these chargers are they have two ports but only can be used at a time?

Half of the chargers need service.
"Trying to actually get to the chargers is a challenge. The car routed me into the parking garage and you can't make a direct left to the chargers. I had to go to the second floor, turn around, then the parking attendant had me make a u-turn in the exit lane to drive the wrong way to the chargers. I hope you all have better luck. The chargers seem to be in the valet Parking lot. Plenty of spaces though."

The chargers are in the mall parking lot. You have about 30 minutes to charge. After that you would need to pay for being in the parking lot $5.00 that kind of sucks but it is what it is.

I did not like this place at all. For starters this is a V2 supercharger. Was there at night. It's crazy but there are no lights at this location. Very dark. Nothing nearby. No restrooms when Tesla store closed.

Dealer leaves unattended cars in the charging station. Meanwhile there's a cue of cars waiting for a spot to open up. Waited 40 minutes while 5 spots were taken up by the dealer that where there before I arrived and where still there after I left.

Super convenient off the 17 at the Tesla dealership. It's sometimes full but you don't have to wait too long for a spot.

It took me 40 minutes to charge from 55 to 90% at this Tesla super charger. Cost me $11.00
First time at this charger. Is that correct to spend thos much time?
This is located at a Wawa super store.

Quick charge. 8 minutes gets 90 mile from 85 to 170.

This is a great stop. Quick off the highway with clean bathroom and a place to buy snack.

This station only had one CHAdeMO charger and chevy/vw cars park backwards in this spot to charge from the other side. The app doesn't always work and customer service likes to blame the customer for their faults. It's not much bragging to be first when you are the only one competing.

"Great setup. Easy charge ( my first one)! And with the Hyundai Ioniq easy peasy. Thanks!... Ugg so yay and no. Lol it's been a crapshoot since October when they overhauled the system, slowed fast chargers, and the app got a lil funky. But over all.. I'm still happy."
Update.. the chargers are still slow comparatively to August of las year (2022) word from ABB ( the maintainer) is that new chargers are rolling out and a true 350 KWH will be among the 150's and that the fastest chargers are to come.

"Although charging is a bit on the slow side it's a decent enough Supercharger. It can be kind of busy at times since it only has 6 chargers, it's also the only Supercharger on I-40 between Santa Rosa and Gallup, it also serves the I-25 corridor. It's in the parking lot of an Applebee's restaurant, so if the restaurant is open, food and a bathroom are available, otherwise, it's pretty bleak. There is a multistory Holiday Inn Express next door."

posted 1/19/23 DISASTER. 2 of the chargers flat out don’t work. look like they were driven over by irresponsible Tesla drivers. the third one i tried attempted to worn and the people beside me we’re getting intermittent power. My guess is something must be amiss w power source. 2.5 miles away is another bunch of chargers in a much better location and they worked fine

Nice place but I didn’t see a convince store or restrooms around. it’s inside a open format mall so there are clothing stores and some restaurants. But you gotta walk a block or two through the parking lot to get to any of them.

great location in an outdoor mall area. kW started very well but dropped off. probably because we were at a pretty high level of charge on our battery pushing it for a long drive to Flagstaff

Employees charge there car here and leave it well after they are finished. The other EV drivers want you to unplug for them; I'm not sure if it is laziness or incompetence but it certainly isn't courteous. The business claims its open to everyone yet they use it for their own personal parking. I wouldn't trust someone else to unplug my car while it is plugged in because then I'd have to leave my car unlocked. These drivers don't realize they are in Albuquerque and they leave their car unlocked.

"Somewhat disappointed in this location. I was spending the evening in downtown SA with my wife and friends and passed on free Valet parking to better further the electric cause and promote Travis Park's program with EV Charging and paid parking. We plugged in, paid our $8, and made our way to dinner and a show. Upon our return, we noticed the charger for my Volt was not working. Evidently, the circuit went cold after about 2 hrs of charging. I am not sure what might have happened, but if 2 hrs is the maximum charge time, this makes the effort much less worth it. I would likely not try this again, unless I learn what the rules and limitations are for this site. 10/6/2012"

One level 2 charger. Not part of a network. Worked great.
Free parking and charge.
Slow charge
Systems were randomly disconnecting. This is the second time this year I've been to this location and charging stops for no reason.
"They really need to put up a sign stating what cars will charge best off which chargers at all EV charging stations. Just because it says 350kw, doesn't mean your car will actually charge faster off it than the 150kw charger."

"This is the first one in a while where all the chargers worked. The nature of EV charging warrants being close to amenities. Unlike gas vehicles it's not a 5-minute process for us. A Walmart is one of the worst places to put an EV charging station because there's next to nothing around most of the time. Then on top of that it's a Walmart. Something that I personally strive to never go in. They stick the chargers way out in the back of the parking lot, not a bathroom in sight. At this location there's not even someplace within reasonable walking distance to grab a bite to eat while you're charging."

"I've seen 2 different configurations of EA Charging Stations: diagonal parking spaces with chargers in-between the spaces, and straight-in spaces with chargers mounted at the head of each space. Diagonal works better for EVs with side-mounted charging ports, and straight-in for EVs with front or back ports. All have very heavy and inflexible cords that tend to stress the EV charging port. Cords should be more flexible and several feet longer."

Difficult to reach charging port on the side of my Bolt and I saw one Taycan driver's solution was to take up 3 spaces to reach his side-mounted port.

None of these work. Though manufactured/operated by Blink the stations are owned by the college and inoperable :/
"The charger on the right has a broken screen so you couldn't touch any of the buttons. The man charging his Mustang (on the left) told me both chargers would not work at the same time. I guess he was right, since mine stopped working after adding a mile or two and charged me $ 4.48. When I came back, I had to start the session over completely (broken screen) and was billed $ 21.45 the second time. This took 1 Hour nd 25 minutes to add 183 miles, not what I call a fast charge. Later in the day I stopped at a EA station and in 11 minutes had added 46 miles. That one was fast!"
No comment from the company when I called asking about the $ 4.48 charge for a broken charger.
Next time I'll drive on to Forsyth and use the EA charger.

Wow. Never saw a truck stop or gas station this large with so much food and shopping. Chopped brisket was awesome. Fresh fruit was great. Unbelievable number of gas pumps. Hugh bathrooms. Amazing fresh beef jerky.

"While the stations work and are clean, the company behind them is the exact opposite. Hidden fees, broken app and holds placed on your bank account that don't go away well after they take their payment. The charge cost claims $.30 a minute. Whole I was there for only 20 minutes, my final cost was over $11. But 20x.3=6, so where did this extra 5 dollar charge come from? According to the final screen it wasn't a 5 dollar tax and it doesn't go into specifics either. No receipt sent via email, no paper receipt and no receipt in the app. Seriously, need to rip people of for a couple extra bucks for choosing to not go to a free charger is only going to drive them to the free chargers. User beware, you may end up paying for more than to are getting here."

"ALERT! Be aware that, not only does ChargePoint charges an additional $5.00 on your credit card on the first purchase (my bill was $22.75 (01:29:00 + 00:01:00 idle time to disconnect ;-( ) CP made 2 charges; 1 for $10 00 + 1 for $20.00), but depending on the state, they can bill either by the kWh used. Or, by the minute (much more expensive)."

"Now that I'm aware of CP charging an additional $5.00, I decided to add $2.25, or so (out of $2.75 credit)."

"After all, why should they be allowed to keep more of my money than they already are?"

"But, when I pulled up to the first charging station, it took me several minutes to get to the point on the app to, Start Charging. :-("

"Once I got it hooked up, and going, all was going OK. Yay!"

"But, after a few seconds, I noticed a, Not Charging, message. :-("

"So, rather than fight that station again, I moved my car to the next one."

"And, finally! Got this station working, and added, $2.29 (about 12 miles) to the my EV."

"Now, to be honest, these public charging stations are great while traveling. However, depending on the state, regular gas vehicles can be cheaper to fill up."

"But, for driving around town, and despite the long time needed to charge on a 110V outlet (12 hours gave me 45 miles. The cost? $0.84! Yes, only eightyfour cents!)."

"So, for gas vs home electric costs, EVs are a much better deal. Though, still cost prohibitive for many people (starting at around $38,000, and can exceed $250,000)."

"But, prices are dropping (just like the first Plasma 40"" set was $14,999.99). And, in a few years, EV prices are expected to be under $30K for the lower end models"

"My EV recommends leaving it plugged in. But, because I live in an open Duplex community, I don't want to risk someone stealing my charger."

"Located in a HyVee parking lot not too far from the highway. It's a V3 Supercharger (250 kW) charging speed. Be sure to start preconditioning your battery early! If it’s not charging fast, then you haven’t driven your car for 3 hours to get here."

"Not the fastest station. It's really out in the middle of nowhere, no trash, no restrooms, no food. Just a few financial/mortgage/investment companies in the gigantic parking area. But in the hour I was here I saw no other people, so at least it's not busy. Easily gains a star if there was a coffee shop nearby."

It was Sooo slow!! We were in spot 3A and could only get 21kw charging power.....we moved to 1A spot and started getting 100kw. It was really terribly long charging here. Positives are: There are some food places nearby and lots of area to walk around while you're waiting.

"Grid shows 8 available spots. Upon arrival at 10% with no other local options, I pull in to find non tesla vehicles parked in every bay but one. Guess what...? That had to be the one with a bent prong making it not fit into port. I went inside the hotel to express concern over the issue. The gal was not helpful at all and simply said sorry the lot is full. When I suggested that she call hotel security to come gather license plate info to cross reference with hotel guests, that's when she said ""well, I can come move my car"". What!? She then came and moved her personal vehicle which was double parked and blocking multiple bays."
Careful guys! This is not a tesla friendly location.
FYI... I was able to macgyver the bent prong and get it back in service.

"The station itself was difficult to locate in the parking lot, and once I did, it wouldn't let me begin a session - which was mildly unnerving as I down to 2% charge on my way to Idaho Falls in 15F weather. (I'm a new EV owner and didn't realize the cold would sap the range as much as it did.) But I called the number on the box and was helped my one of the nicest customer service people I can ever recall talking to. (I think her name was Tiffany but can't remember for sure.) She was very patient with me and got the session going as quickly as she could, and Electrify America comped the entire thing as it was New Year's Eve. After that everything went smoothly. So, while this particular station itself wasn't the greatest, I'm still giving 5 stars because of the OUTSTANDING customer service."

(I'm a new EV owner and didn't realize the cold would sap the range as much as it did.) But I called the number on the box and was helped my one of the nicest customer service people I can ever recall talking to. (I think her name was Tiffany but can't remember for sure.) She was very patient with me and got the session going as quickly as she could, and Electrify America comped the entire thing as it was New Year's Eve. After that everything went smoothly.

"Good charge rate, can get a bit busy. Driving through but Jackson looks like a nice town to check out in the future. In the Whole Foods parking lot because, of course. EV friendly organic eco-conscious hippies. :) Pretty sure most people here are coming in or out of Teton/Yellowstone."

Nice super charger. Whole Foods is always clean and has good stuff. Well lit.

"Four of the eight stations had non-EVs occupying them when we got there. Closer inspection showed that 30 minute general parking is allowed for alternate stalls, but while we were charging (7/11/22), the store updated signage such that all eight superchargers are allowed for 30 minute general parking. So basically, you can't trust the number of open stalls indicated by app or nav system. Tesla should consider finding a more reliable location in Jackson. It's a busy parking lot and forming a line is not a good option. If you need to use it, off hours are likely advisable."

I was getting range anxiety as we got closer to the super charger and I was worried about finding a spot and about how fast it would charge because of the previous reviews. Fortunately we found a spot. It charged quickly and it was a good experience. I took 1 start off though because as mentioned in other reviews there are more non electric cars parked here than those that need it. There were plenty of normal spots open but apparently they all prefer the Tesla parking. 1 guy parked here and then went into the apartments behind the store. Lame.

"Seconding what others have said about this location. I was in Jackson for a week and probably used this charging station 10x. Out of those 10x, there was a gas truck parked in a Tesla spot about 30% of the time, which is lame considering there were plenty of open general parking spots at the time."

"Otherwise the location is great - just outside the town square, in a Whole Foods parking lot, and a very short walk to Cowboy Coffee where you can get coffee, tea, drinks, snacks and burritos."

Im a salty Tesla owner who doesn't own Chademo to Tesla adapter so this charging station was completely unusable to me. I am sure it worked fine and the station itself was clean and looked ready to use.

When you're on a family trip and you have made plans to charge to 100%. It's absolutely maddening to be limited to 80%. It's even more maddening when you see that only three out of the eight stations are busy. I've been a proud Tesla owner since 2015 and an investor since before then. I love what they're doing but they can do better here.

"I fully understand that there are busy holiday times but this was not a busy holiday. This was a Monday night on a non-holiday weekday. Yes, it was the evening when everyone leaves the park but that's very predictable and we need more superchargers."

It seems like every road trip I go on I run into some kind of limitation of availability or some mitigation Tesla has put in place for limited availability.

It's time to grow up Tesla You're only going to be more popular from here on out.

"3A was charging at half speed until I moved to a different stall. If you're not getting 100+ kW and the only car there and not near 80% try it. Also the guy complaining being limited to 80%, it does that if it's busy but you can still adjust it to 100%. They just want to get the line moving but you can override it."

We charge here frequently. The charger is located next to the Grizzly and Wolf discovery center. A great place to visit.
"Only a few steps further is the IMAX with a large gift store. Next to it is the Yellowstone visitor center. From here you can walk thru town, enjoy the gift stores, restaurants, ice cream and much more."
Most likely you will have to move your car from the charger before you’re done exploring town as these Supercharger are so fast.

"This is my second time charging my car at this station. The reason that I gave 3 is that the charging rate drop so fast comparing to other stations. The location is great, in the parking lot of Holiday Inn. I am taking my husky for a road trip, can’t stay at this hotel as they don’t take pets. If you stay at this hotel and have no pets, this station is perfect."

"This Tesla Supercharger location in Columbia, Missouri has been completely full the last few times I've driven between Saint Louis and Kansas City. It would be nice to have another location between here and St Louis. There are multiple options between Columbia and KC."

Jimmy John's is across the street and a gas station very nearby without sidewalks to it. Otherwise everything else seems to be across the highway or 3-5 miles down the highway.

Supercharger was fine. Easy to get to off the highway. Hope you like Jimmy Johns if you're looking for a place to eat.

"If traveling with kids, this is not the best stop to charge for a long charge because there's really nothing around. The Iron House gym next door kept our 2 yr old somewhat preoccupied with flipping tires outside which was so nice of them. We opted to only charge for 10 minutes and then hit the next stop at St. Charles for a longer charge."

"Update mid-Nov 2022: it appears this issue has been fixed, at least on the 350 kw on the left facing the chargers. Stars changed accordingly"

Horrible station. None of the chargers would stay above 40-50 kw. Total waste of time.
Got a fast charge in on our road trip and enjoyed a walk around the field behind the store! This is a great charger if you have dogs to walk.

"Very convenient location, normal convenience store (Hy-Vee) across the street to the west ( snakes, roller grill, caribou coffee and free air). Hy-Vee Grocery store to the east which has a a great set down cafe or salad bar, and Grand buffet that includes Chinese, Italian, and American selections. Chill's Bar and Grill just north west of the chargers.... Plus a Starbucks in Hy-Vee and then a stand alone store within walking distance"

"I have mixed feelings. They are trying. But man, if you don't have a house or are traveling, it's rough. Charged here a few times and it is hit or miss if the Ford app knows if a charger is being used or not. And when you get there, the not sure, tends to be down. Today, it was down sort of... charging slow??? Like 30 instead of the usual 100+ I usually get. It was complimentary session which is great and all, but twenty minutes and only went from 3% to 20.... and it should be full of taking everything that can be thrown at it when the battery is that low and not throttled. I still search for Electrify America chargers because I connect my car, and it works without me further interacting. No other charger has I got to do that even though Ford says the other ones should. So.... they are doing some things right."

I still search for Electrify America chargers because I connect my car, and it works without me further interacting. No other charger has I got to do that even though Ford says the other ones should. So.... they are doing some things right."
"I have mixed feelings. They are trying. But man, if you don't have a house or are traveling, it's rough. Charged here a few times and it is hit or miss if the Ford app knows if a charger is being used or not. And when you get there, the not sure, tends to be down.

Very inconvenient and waste of time! Called regarding slow speed multiple times and they don’t care to fix the issue nor reflect it on the app that charging speed is slow or if the chargers are not working all together.

Upgraded CCS charging station are good. Has 6 parking space but only 4 usable space because of the placement of the stations.

"Easy to use, large crisp display, simple GUI controls for starting the charge process on the CHAdeMO quick charger, and conveniently located within a short walk to Walmart or a gas station convenience store. I highly recommend this charging station to any EV owner, but especially to those with a late model Nissan Leaf."

Horrible slow charging speed and random disconnects!! Called customer service multiple times and they don’t do anything about it!

"It is faster and has more working chargers than the Stafford location, so that’s a win comparatively."

This is a Charge-Point station located in the Fast Park Hobby airport. Parking is relatively cheap and covered. Only negative is the spaces are very tight.

As long as food keep in mind that only if you leave one stall open in between cars (to get 50kw) it's pleasant.
"If it gets down to 13kw, it become clear that we're far from a capacity to ""only"" double the amount of electric cars on the road."

"Great supercharge! I usually have to stop here when traveling to Galveston from Houston when visiting family or showing a home and don’t have time to preplan. Super fast and convenient. Clean and easy to locate. I recommend this charging station. You can even get BBQ if you’re hungry, while waiting."

"Great location to charge south of Houston. Rudy’s BBQ is in the parking lot, the food is good and the bathrooms are always clean. Academy sports is within walking distance and can occupy some moments while you charge. I’ve never been here when it’s completely full and I always get a quick charge."

I visited here on a Weekday evening and there were about 2 stalls open. Pretty busy though considering its proximity to HEB where you can shop and charge. Wish more HEBs had Tesla superchargers...

Only had 3 other cars 7 open stall when I arrived here at about 650am on a Thursday morning but within 10 minutes filled up and only had 1 spot open. It was fairly easy in and easy out. No damaged or non functioning chargers.

Charged my EV very quick. I was skeptical of it being an actual level 3 charging system with 4 CCS chargers and 2 CHADeMO chargers. Decently priced too...will be back!

Consistently only gives 35 kwh. I've came here 3 times total between 20-50 miles left on my ev and I've never seen the charging level go above 35 kw on my car. Electrify America always gives me close to the max fast charging on my car. Charging by the minute and only giving 70% of the max charge level is quite an awful practice. I'll try two more times because I get evgo for free for a bit but after that credit runs out I will never use evgo again.

I was the only vehicle there and it was charging slower than a regular charger. This is not a fast charger. And it’s so far from the grocery store you have to walk all the way up there and in the end it barely charged. Will not charge there again. Waste of my time

This is right in front of the H‑E‑B gas station a clear throwing the towel in the face of gas cars. The distance so good that when people are filling their gas they can wait and see the Tesla charger at one hand distance. The big H‑E‑B store is walking distance and good for grocery shopping while the charging occurs. The area is nice and clean. Only 1 charger was down and tied up with Jute rope but other chargers were all working. Gave 4 stars due to one charger not maintained properly.

Only 1 charger was down and tied up with Jute rope but other chargers were all working. Gave 4 stars due to one charger not maintained properly.

Clean and everything works great!
Only charges in College station! nice area and an H-E-B only a few 100ft away to shop whilst you charge!
Update - This Station works ONLY if you have the CCS Addapter.
Had to use an app it worked pretty well; instructions were a little confusing at first

Was able to use this for 3-4 hours of charging my Tesla today (38 miles an hour). The second charger seems to be for other generic EV. We did not stay at this hotel so just the fact that it is available is a pretty big plus for travelers already. Knocked off one star since the connector for the Tesla seems to be coming loose (some taping was done) let's hope it won't get further damaged and fixed at some point.

"This stop is probably our favorite south of Orlando. We charged at 80kW 342 mi/hr. There are 8 super chargers with 4 parking spots on both sides of the chargers. Plenty of space to go for a walk along the sidewalk while you wait. About fifty steps away is the Crafty Crab seafood boil restaurant that’s absolutely delicious. Also if you need a restroom, you can order a coke at their bar."

This was my first time charging at FPL Evolution. Charger number 4 did not work. I had to move to charger number 1. The location is great because is right next to a Dunkin donuts and a Racetrack gas station. Very convenient for a quick bite or use the restroom.

Worked fine...charged at a rate of 70KW with no other cars charging.
Love these chargers. Easiest to use I've ever ran into. They charge your vehicle so fast based on the vehicle capacity and capability. And I hear they are going to be upgraded to charge even faster. Best ones by far.

Was pretty busy but it’s the shopping season. Only place to eat nearby is the sports bar and a Winn Dixie. I’ve been there a few times and never had to wait.

"Excellent SC location supporting local and interstate traveller's with I-95 close by. Plenty of shade to enjoy while charging. Winn-Dixie Deli has a fresh selection of entrees, sandwiches, snacks and drinks to fuel up on."

Charging stations are becoming busy now and they are being heavily used so they require frequent maintenance… I am not sure what the plan is but it seems like things are way behind lots of broken chargers or chargers operating at 30% capacity. And the chargers omit an extremely loud buzzing noise almost as if the circuit is overloaded charging was very very slow and took about three times longer than the average time of 35 minutes not that impressed considering the fact that it was a $20 charge.

"At least three chargers working fine 12/30/2022. Remove 1 star for the location because there are no amenities if you're not a Sam's Club member. However, there are a Dunkin, an iHop, and a Waffle House within about 200 meters."

"This station has been slowly degrading in quality and reliability. It is constantly busy (when it does work), and if you are lucky to get a charge started, expect it to max at at maybe 50kwh. I have not successfully charged here in about two months, and there is no status update from Electrify America as to when these 2year old chargers will be replaced."

"This stop was pretty horrible. One station was down, the other stations was reduced, which apparently meant 2 kWh charge rate, and the 350 station was also severely reduced. The Audi on the final station available was only charging at 35kWh."

Not far from the interstate at the Wawa gas station. I was there around 6 pm on a weekday and there was no one. McDonald’s next door. I was there only for 20 mins and was able to make it home. Spacious.

"While staying Vero Beach for the week, we had a long drive up to the highway to charge. Came to find all stalls full with one car waiting (and one stall out of commission), so I came back later that night. Clearly a lot of demand in this area!"

"Great stop, has a great McDonald's nearby, we got carryout and within 20mins of pulling in to the 250kw station we were already on our way! Actually took us longer to eat than charge so we ended up charging more than we needed to, even better for our road trip."

"There's also a Wawa nearby for any small things you may need, and the stalls were all empty in the morning. Great stop for any road trip if you are coming by this way, it's right off the highway, low traffic, friendly people, very fast charging, and good amenities right there next to you."

Love that the Florida Turnpike Service Plazas have introduced the ChargePoint at this location along with a few others. If doing the electric vehicle thing it’s easy to hook up and walk over to the plaza for a cup of coffee. Be ready to get some steps in along the way! #chargepoint #chargingstation #fortdrum #serviceplaza
"I’m giving it to rate 2 of five stars because only two of five stations are working on a busy, bright Saturday. The other problem is that because of the river flow parking, it assumes that everyone charges the car in the front which is quite the opposite of the majority. ChargePoint recently partnered with FPL and I expected a higher quality. Instead, the charging rate was low at about 52 kW when I finally got one of the two available stations"
"I’m really concerned because it’s a busy stop and when I called in for service, ChargePoint didn’t have any urgency to get it fixed."

Not a bad experience here. Lot's of chargers to pick from. The one I picked worked but at half speed 70-80kw which was about 30% charge in 15 minutes for 7 bucks.

"I took a road trip to check out EV charging stations to see if my wife's new car should be an EV. The answer an EV is not practical in Southern New England. Far too many charging stations like this one are out of order. Some chargers along route 24 are vandalized with missing charging cables, others are out of order."
We ended up trading in my wife's 2011 toyota corolla S with 150k miles got $5500 for it and bought a 2022 Nissan Kicks SR w/Premium package. No worries for our road trips. We have our Wrangler and our Kicks. Can "recharge" both to over.a 340 mile.range in 3 minutes. Range does not degrade over time. That's more practical for us.

I am a new customer to this Merchant. Using Google Maps it brought me right to the charging station inside a garage. Everything worked as planned and it charged my vehicle within two and a half hours. It sent me a confirmation text of the health of the battery and the state of charge. Nice to have something go as stated. This is only my second time using the service hopefully it'll continue to work as it should

"Easy to initiate once the app is running. A bit pricey since it charges 30 cents per minute and doesn't always reach the 50kw limit. 2020 Bolt charged for an hour started at 34kw tapering down to 21kw to charge from 32%to 78% in 50 degree weather with warm battery pack. Restaurant right there, The Black Whale, was great."

"Tesla is the place to go to see the line of new cars they offer. The sales people are great and friendly. I was there to check out a car for a person who is handicapped. He fell in love with the cars they offer. However, very pricey as they should be for the quality of car it offers."

You have to pay for the parking before you can access the charger. It’s $3 in addition to the charging fee. Location is inside a secured parking garage in a mall. Area is clean and the charger is fairly fast.

You have to pay for parking to get to the chargers on top of the charging fee. I can't see how anyone could rate this place higher than a 1 star. In NJ they are all over the place and open to the public. FREE WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY FOR PARKING.

Would give 0 stars if we could. Not only do you pay for the garage but they are ripping you off requesting $35 cash ON TOP OF the payment for the garage and on top of the fee to charge. Beware.

Arrived on a Friday prior to the Labor Day long weekend. Place was packed and full with a couple cars waiting. Not the most convenient place to charge as you need to exit Interstate 81 and head down Binghamton’s busy Main Street. The only positive with the location is the Sonic across the street. We ended up not charging here. I had just enough charge to make it to the Destiny shopping mall Supercharger on Syracuse.

The charge was quick and up to standard. That wasn’t the problem. The was that there was nothing around the supercharger other than The Spot restaurant.

"Also, supercharger 1A was pointless because you couldn’t pull up into the spot. The plants there were out of control! If you really did park there, you leave with some scratches as souvenirs. If there are other spots available than this would not be a problem. Just something to keep in mind."

Now, you plug in immediately, then select the charger in the app and start the charging by sweeping right. The new element is that you now must place your phone by the proximity reader to start charging, I imagine for enhanced security. The charging went quickly and flawlessly."

It is very excellent charging
Having a EVgo Charging Station is the latest way to become hip and be “one with nature” and I happen to think caring for the environment is a cool thing so yes this should be welcomed to any location. Whole Foods would be proud! Never seem to see many cars taking advantage of this location so I decided to review it so it would stand out more. Have done the hybrid route but never an full electric car. Maybe I’ll give one a try as a second mode of transportation.#evgo #chargingstation

It’s fine. By 730 am on a Sunday all chargers were occupied. Plenty of snacks at the Wawa . It’s a sketchy area - strip mall city off of I-95 ..did the trick

"Fast Charger, but the restrooms at the Wawa Station are horrible. So dirty. Also, the store isn't clean as well."

"The charger is high frequency, so it charges only 80%. I was there around 2 pm on the weekend."

Chargers always work which is all I really expect. Other reviews are the bathroom are accurate lol. Don’t use unless an absolute emergency. Chipotle and other restaurants to eat while you charge.

I was one of 3 other Teslas waiting to charge. There are insufficient stations available in Ft. Lauderdale.

This is the 3rd time for me. Are plans being made to add new a facility or expand the only one in Ft Lauderdale?

Now. the gas station WAMA won't let the public use the bathroom

Very conveniently located just off of I-95 on Powerline Rd. and W. Cypress Creek Rd. It is right in Wawa Gas Station and all a busy area. You feel safe to charge all day and night. There are 8 stations and always busy.

They need to mark clearly these spots as “Electric Vehicle Charging Only” ... if you’re not accustomed to looking for the charging stations they’re easy to miss. Otherwise great amenity for this hotel!

"Fast, clean, and efficient. Primarily talking about Tesla's, but this place was pretty good too. No real amenities, but there's a grocery store nearby, that is pretty much everything you need. It's one of those off to the side kind of places, so you're going to need to wander around the grocery store for a few minutes before your car is topped off."

"Do NOT use charger 4A. Max charge if 70 miles per hour charge. I sat for an hour and gained only 50 miles of range. I moved to 2A and it jumped to 250 miles of range. Very irritating. Also, this charger is in the middle of nowhere. Exits are tough to figure out, too."

"I gave it 4-stars because it’s way, way better than running out of battery."

"The Supercharger is fine, fast, fairly new, rarely full. It's in the far corner from the doors to the Meijer grocery, closest to the highway. Plenty of room to walk the dog, or have a picnic."

It works and is at a Meijer store. Decent stop. Depending on the direction you are coming from you may need to go through a few roundabouts.

So this is supposed to be a level 3 charger at 50KW. Max i got today was 19KW. Might need to look at this.

"Great proximity to Lambeau Field. This is the only pro. The rest is opinion based, not a con but a nugget to help you decide if you want to seek out this particular parking space. My charge door is on the driver side. I need to technically park in the space backwards to get the charger to reach without it draping across my hood. This whole situation is situated in front of the Titletown tech building. This lot is total chaos! People parked in all directions, Diagonal directional parking would have made this experience a lot less sketchy. I mean I'm supposed to be in the fancy part of town where everything is just better...like the team and the whole district it al seems to be falling a little flat in terms of actual value and entertainment associated with doubling prices of all goods in a general area where you can't keep your 30million dollar main attraction happy. Beware of shiny garbage, it's still garbage. Fairly clean area, nice place to stretch your legs!"

People parked in all directions, Diagonal directional parking would have made this experience a lot less sketchy. I mean I'm supposed to be in the fancy part of town where everything is just better...like the team and the whole district it al seems to be falling a little flat in terms of actual value and entertainment associated with doubling prices of all goods in a general area where you can't keep your 30million dollar main attraction happy. Beware of shiny garbage, it's still garbage. Fairly clean area, nice place to stretch your legs!"
"This is the quickest available Supercharger in the general vicinity (within 60 square miles). As of March 8th, 2023, all chargers are fully operational.

Nice location. Got up to 195kW so I'm sure it goes 250 in the summer.

First time using a Tesla supercharger for our Model Y and it was so easy and fast! Took 20 minutes to charge from 20% to 80%! Lots of stuff to do around the charger too.

"People will park trucks and trailers infront of all 8 chargers and then harass you when you ask them nicely to move. This is a consistent issue, and people need go be understanding that this is the equivalent to a gas pump and not start a dispute over it. Wawa does not enforce law, which makes it illegal for ICE cars to park in the stalls. Signs are there."

Not expected speed but good enough.

Excellent location in the Philadelphia Mills parking lot directly across the street from Taco Bell and McDonald's. Only 2 minutes off I-95.
Do not have electric car. But if I did it's good place to go
Terrible

Was very disappointed. This charger took up a while hour of my day and only gave me a 20% charge. Was shocked. I would recommend finding a different charging service. I used electrify America afterwards and was so happy. And also paid so much less

"A bit of a mess. The chargers only charge one car at a time, even though they have two ports on each charger. Very tight location and busy with Sam's traffic. Also, there's only two 350 chargers and two spaces. Yes, it's free so why am I griping? Well, be prepared to wait a while to charge, be careful about traffic in the parking area as Sam's folks seem to fly down the parking isles and the Sam's bathrooms are terribly dirty. Ever hopeful there will be more chargers very soon in locations more suited to fast, safe, effective charging."

Well, be prepared to wait a while to charge, be careful about traffic in the parking area as Sam's folks seem to fly down the parking isles and the Sam's bathrooms are terribly dirty. Ever hopeful there will be more chargers very soon in locations more suited to fast, safe, effective charging."

Easy enough to find. Well lit area. The charger was a 350KW but the max I got was 110kw and that was starting from 39% and my car can do a max of 210KW so disappointing

Fast charger here. Hint put your Electrify America Digital card in Apple Wallet and do not put phone near the Card reader but put near the Reader icon to the right tap and start. Works great.

"As too typical for Electrify America sites, something didn’t work. In this case the system said the pass reader wasn’t working, then the app wouldn’t override it. We charged chargers and things worked fine, then the next guy shows up to use the charger we couldn’t start and it randomly worked for him. Still, we appreciate these sites exist at all."

"These Tesla Super Charger are super easy to back up too. This is one of my favorite places to use when I need a charge. There are many stores and restaurants to zip into. Also, the mall is across the street depending on how long you are charging."

"There is a lot of traffic in the area so it may be confusing to get in. Once you get in, there are a lot of shops to visit while charging. This charger is also incredibly quick - ours was charging at 1000 mi/hr with 3 other Tesla's charging at the same time!"

Not a public station and is on private property. I have no idea why ChargePoint still says it is public. I asked them a year ago to reclassify it after trying and failing to use it in an emergency situation. It is time-of-use AND pass code protected. It is difficult to trust ChargePoint especially when on private property.

"We visited the casino and buffet on a concert night. We had to stand in line for the buffet to wait for tables to open up. They had a sign up explaining they were short staffed like so many other places, which I understand. There was one long table with Reserved signs on it that nobody ever sat at - I am thinking that was probably related to short staffing and trying to keep up. I don't eat meat so I asked if I could order the kids grilled cheese and fries, which they were nice enough to let me. I was actually surprised how fast my meal came considering, and it was hot and fresh. My husband had the buffet for $25 because he has always been about quantity over quality. When he left food on his plate and only made two trips through, you know it's BAD! He said the selection was way down from when he has been there in previous years. He said the food was just gross. He admitted my idea of picking up pizza in Mandan would have been much better."

"We did wander around the casino area for a little while before and after the concert. The layout is not crowd friendly, as there are so many machines jam packed in there that you add a few people and there is not much room to move."

"I thought the concert hall was extremely warm, and I am the one that is always cold, so it had to have been bad! Our seats were right under a light on the side wall, which glared in our eyes and made it hard to watch people coming and going while we waited for the concert to begin."

There was one long table with Reserved signs on it that nobody ever sat at - I am thinking that was probably related to short staffing and trying to keep up. I don't eat meat so I asked if I could order the kids grilled cheese and fries, which they were nice enough to let me. I was actually surprised how fast my meal came considering, and it was hot and fresh. My husband had the buffet for $25 because he has always been about quantity over quality. When he left food on his plate and only made two trips through, you know it's BAD! He said the selection was way down from when he has been there in previous years. He said the food was just gross. He admitted my idea of picking up pizza in Mandan would have been much better."

"We did wander around the casino area for a little while before and after the concert. The layout is not crowd friendly, as there are so many machines jam packed in there that you add a few people and there is not much room to move."

"I thought the concert hall was extremely warm, and I am the one that is always cold, so it had to have been bad! Our seats were right under a light on the side wall, which glared in our eyes and made it hard to watch people coming and going while we waited for the concert to begin."

They have added a plastic cover on the south side to prevent people from parking on the south side of the chargers even though it really wouldn't take much difference as there is only about an 8 inch difference from which side of the concrete the supercharger is on. So it's more just a deterrent to get people to the right side! (North)

This has been the most reliable Electrify America (EA) location that I've encountered. Most EA locations utilize what I've come to think of as "plug and pray" technology because that's what EA customers find themselves doing. Praying that the charger is going to actually work.

"Thankfully, I've visited this location on multiple road trips up into the Lassen National Forrest. I found that the chargers worked every time which is truly miraculous as any frequent EA customer knows. These appear to be updated charging units and I suspect this explains my good fortune."

"Near by food and beverage amenities are abundant. Stoble's coffee is my fav. Lots of options within reasonable walking distance in a safe, small town, downtown district area."

"My only complaint is that when this area is busy and the lot is full of ICE cars and EVs, EV drivers who must back into these angled stalls will have some difficulty (i.e. backing in without touching the Rivian in the stall to the right; or the Lucid Air in the stall to the left; or without ramming into bubba's truck nuts equipped tow hitch on the F-250 parked in the stall directly on the other side of the one way lane)."

"I wish EA wouldn't just cram these chargers into random, small sized parking lots with limited approach angles and limited maneuvering space. For real, when full, it is challenging to back in. Even worse, the cords are too short to reach the back of my teeny tiny Polestar 2 when pulling in nose first! If EA could at least give us longer cords at this location the issue I just described would be avoidable."

If EA could at least give us longer cords at this location the issue I just described would be avoidable."
This has been the most reliable Electrify America (EA) location that I've encountered. Most EA locations utilize what I've come to think of as "plug and pray" technology because that's what EA customers find themselves doing. Praying that the charger is going to actually work.

"Thankfully, I've visited this location on multiple road trips up into the Lassen National Forrest. I found that the chargers worked every time which is truly miraculous as any frequent EA customer knows. These appear to be updated charging units and I suspect this explains my good fortune."

"Near by food and beverage amenities are abundant. Stoble's coffee is my fav. Lots of options within reasonable walking distance in a safe, small town, downtown district area."

"My only complaint is that when this area is busy and the lot is full of ICE cars and EVs, EV drivers who must back into these angled stalls will have some difficulty (i.e. backing in without touching the Rivian in the stall to the right; or the Lucid Air in the stall to the left; or without ramming into bubba's truck nuts equipped tow hitch on the F-250 parked in the stall directly on the other side of the one way lane)."

New to charging an EV and this is a good location and seems safe in a bank parking lot. Rates are pretty good with the membership at about 50% the price of gas equivalent.

passed this location on Aug 29. 3/4charging station can’t initiate the charging session. Good news is it is not busy and we are able to use the one (01) that is 150kw. Next to Walmart so it is super convenient for restrooms and refill snacks and water.

"It's a challenge to locate these chargers. I nearly got directed to the freeway. The app has the chargers listed with silly names for identification purposes, but only one of the 4 machines has a name listed on the actual unit. It was trial and error attempting to determine which charger I was actually parked in front of. Additionally, the parking lot was flooded almost entirely and it was tricky to navigate around it to the chargers, which were also ponding about 3-4 inches deep."

One of the 350 kWh plugs didn't work. The interface is super slow also. Charging speeds vary on weather and the time you're there but that is expected. Customer service in the phone are pretty good and answer quickly if you want to report broken chargers. UPDATE: the interface was upgraded to be quicker but still not the best and there's some lag to start the charging session. The 150 kWh and the 350 kWh charger at the same speed!!!

"Pretty good charge, last time I stopped here to charge was about 4 mos ago and there were maybe Teslas in an out as we charged. Tonight we were there longer because I wanted more than the minimum to get home and every space was filled with occasion emptied. Generally a good spot with a Harris Teeter off the left and a Walgreens to the rear and a couple restaurants straight ahead across the parking lot. My only concern was the darkness of the area at night."

"The super charger was fine, but the area is not that great. The roads are rough, and the Sheetz that it was located at was OK but the restrooms were not the greatest. The grass where I had to walk my dog was not all that clean either."

"You can definitely find a spot here, but doesn't seem like the greatest neighborhood. It is at a Sheetz 24 hour gas station. There is gas station food so you can grab a quick bite. Doesn't look like there is much else around. Also seems like non Tesla's park here as well as depicted in the picture."

Good place to stop and charge. You pay for parking at this location 1.00 per hour. Worth it. There is a great coffee place close to here and the university which is nice. Reminds me of OU.

"Excellent location. The chargers are located in the parking garage (always open) across from the hotel. There are 4 Tesla destination chargers, one of them was not working. There is also a ChargePoint charger. The Tesla chargers are totally free, which is very nice. As you can see from the picture, it was charging my vehicle at a rate of 39 miles/hour, pretty good. Also, the nice thing about this location is, if you needed to charge for an hour or two, you could hang out in the nice, cool (or warm in winter) hotel lobby, with restrooms, etc. You could also walk to eating places nearby."

"Only one CHAdeMO charger vs I think 7 CCS, the cord wasn't very long, I had to leave my car sticking out to plug in, and tap-and-pay was broken. Also didn't take Discover despite saying it did. Unfortunately it's the only CHAdeMO charger anywhere nearby"

Great place to charge on the way up to Logan and beyond. Stopped here on our way to Bear Lake. There are a few eating places around so you can grab a bite while you wait.

We tried to find this station and had no idea where it is. Location is not accurate. Please update.
Parking is blocked off by either customers or vehicles waiting to be serviced. Very bad spot for a charging station.

Horribly slow every time. Says 150kw but I've never got above 80kw. Others say they are getting about the same. They do have some new chargers but I was only getting 63kw on them.

"EDIT: It does indeed exist. It’s near the street, in the corner of the parking lot. Not at the “address” or business listed."

"The charger is seemingly non existent. I called the 800 number, spoke to someone who suggested I download the chargelab app. That shows the chargers are located at Kenco. I looked all around that building and even tried to look through their fence/gate to see if I could at least see them in the back but no. I’ve opened a zen desk ticket with chargelab to get more info."

"The Superchargers were great, very fast speeds, for a 40%SoC. The location was a little suspect at night if you were alone, with that said, we went there twice while staying in Shreveport for a business trip, other Tesla owner showed up each time which makes people more comfortable."

"Only real complaint was a fellow tesla owner dumping their trash out there door. They did have a very sweet dog they let my wife pet, but still throw your trash in a can."

I would steer clear of this one if possible. Make the extra push to Monroe or just stop in for 5-10 mins. There were several people aimlessly wandering around in the area talking to themselves. It looks like a scene from The Walking Dead.

Solid charging station. Charged super quick with access to a small mall to stretch your legs. Fair restroom facility within the mall. Kids loved the little turtle lagoon with many live turtles. Limited dining options as there is no central food court.

I thought the space for pulling into the chargers was a little tight and the space was also used for parking. There were places you could drop a trailer if you were towing and needed to charge.

"As of early August 2022, stall #1 (100183-01) is not working, and they know about it. They are waiting on parts to fix it. If they know it’s not working, why does the screen instruct you to plug in?

I thought they were just going to the hotel, but then cornered me in a parking spot once I was plugged in and gave some sob story about needing cash. PD was there within 3 minutes of me calling though. Seems like a shady enough place that this behavior could catch on. Louisiana residents in surrounding towns generally avoid the city of Monroe."

"Extremely slow charger. I have used it twice on a road trip. Both times we got no more than 60kW. With it being a popular charger, only having 6 stalls, and no other Supercharger for hours, it causes Teslas to stack up in wait. This is the worst charger I’ve run into."

"I've used this charger a couple of times but today when I needed it, the CHAdeMO charger was not function (as were three of the CCS chargers). EA operator suggested it was an unknown error but it would be 24 hours to have someone correct."

This is not a serious EV charging company. They exhibit no commitment to reliable charging infrastructure. Their "best effort" attitude seems to be OK for the ice cream machine at McDonalds but don't put your trip at risk of trusting EA to get you where you're going. They clearly do not care.

There were plenty of open chargers with 4 cars including mine charging.

Works great but there is only two chargers. It can easily fill up during weekdays. Sometimes it is possible to park in an adjacent spot and stretch the charging cord (if the vehicle occupying the EV space is already fully charged).

This vehicle belongs to one of the Domino’s Pizza employees (Domino’s routinely brings their company Bolt EV to the lot to charge). Wonder why they parked their personal gas vehicle in the electric vehicle charging spot? I was able to back in at an angle and connect my EV for charging.

The two high-powered EVgo chargers were not working. Had reported the issue to EVgo a week earlier and still had not been fixed. I did not try the "slower" fast chargers.

"Chargers at the Somerst turnpike service station, at the truck end of the car section. This was 2% charge further eastbound than the Somerset exit charger that’s behind a fast food place, so worth editing the car’s recommendation. Zero others used a charger during my charge at 4PM on weekday in summer"

"WARNING!!!! TOLL TRAP!!! There is a supercharger in the town of Somerset that you can use if you're trying to avoid tolls (1030 N Ctr Ave, Somerset, PA 15501). It's just 2 miles from this one. I was close to it, but the car forced me to get on the Turnpike and navigated me to this one instead, even though avoid tolls was selected for my trip!"

The Sheetz is busy so keep an eye out when getting to and out of the chargers area as the drive thru is like oncoming traffic. Seating area in the Sheetz lets you keep an eye on your vehicle. Chargers themselves weren't full on the Wednesday evening in the summer when I stopped to charge. Not much else in walking distance. Traffic can be heavy to get to and from the Sheetz but convenient location to I-99.

Went late night
Felt perfectly safe
Easy to see from the main road. Plenty of space around it. Signage to discourage non eve users for more than 15 minutes. All stations appeared operational.

Right next to a typical Sheetz.

Pricing was better than it is back in MD.

I usually stop here when I visit my brother and his family. Very convenient location and easy to get to.

It is located at a Sheetz convenience store. Separate area for charging and a great selection of drinks and food that you can purchase.

Clean restrooms and open 24 hours a day. Sheetz should have more of these

"Tesla should shut this place down. It’s barely a Supercharging station at 49kw (204/hr). Plenty of fast food options close by but most require crossing very busy toads w/ no crosswalk, Wendy’s entrance is only 200’ away. In these Covid times forgot about any nearby open bathrooms. Your better off heading to the 150kW Superchargers at Breezewood (44 miles to the east) or North Huntingdon 37 miles to the west) if traveling along the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76)."

This supercharger is very close to the turnpike. It is located behind the Wendy's. The Wendy's is very clean and the bathrooms are newly renovated. There isn't much else to walk to while you wait and the parking lot had tons of pot holes which is why I gave 4 stars.

"One of my least favorite charging stops. There's nothing wrong with the terminals, just the process of getting in and out is so painful. This is the intersection of multiple highways. Expect to spend about 15 minutes on top of your plan to stop sitting in traffic. Expect there to be a line for the bathroom. Expect for the parking lot to be so crowded that multiple charging slots are used by non-Tesla vehicles."

"Protip- the lights to exit the sheetz have approximately a four-minute cycle. There's always a massive line to exit the gas station. Wait until the lights turn green and the entire queue clears out onto the street. Quickly get out of your car disconnect the charger and then pull forward and you'll be at the front of the queue. Exit the gas station in 4 minutes when the light next turns green. If you want to be really fancy proactively unplug your car, wait until the exit queue clears and then quickly pull onto the tail of the line to exit the gas station without waiting at all."

Good spot to charge. Sheetz has public bathrooms and plenty of food along with WiFi and an eating area to hang out. There are some outdoor seating areas too. The subtraction of one star is simply due to the difficulty of getting out of Sheetz since the intersection has long lights.

"Ok, so it works, which is good. But, what a pain to get working. You have to download an app, make an account, verify your phone number, then they charge you $10 and, if you go under $5, they charge you another $10… how about just charge me what I actually spent? So, maybe 5-10 minutes to get started, and then I ended up spending $21 for an $8 charge. It feels like they’re actively trying to make this harder than necessary."

Nice well lit place by the Wawa to charge up your EV. You can chill out and even get a shorty and coffee at the Wawa while you wait. Did this at midnight and never at any point felt unsafe.

"Best option for supercharging in the city but you need to pay for parking in order to charge. But the way to get around that would be to make an $8 or more purchase from the MOMs Organic Market above the garage, get your ticket validated for 2hrs of free parking and your supercharge session will be ""free"". Only gripe was that there were 2 non Tesla’s parked in the Tesla spot for what looked like a prolonged period of time so the 7 Tesla spots were actually 5 available spots and I would never of known that from the Tesla navigation system that tells me how many spots are open."

"Be advised this is in a paid parking lot. Unless, you go to Mom’s organic supermarket and spend $8, you get 2 free hours of parking. Out of the 2 supercharging options in Philly centre city area right now (8/19), this is the better option during daylight hours. A little hard to find as the Tesla sign is very small to spot. Only reason this gets a 3⭐️ because of the Mom’s organic supermarket. Otherwise, I feel like Tesla could do better than this"

"Proximity to other places you may need to go is very convenient and this place does DC fast charging. It's away from main line of sight which is good as random people who aren't charging their cars shouldn't accidentally take up a space. My negatives were: of the 3 stations (2 plugs per station ) only 1 was operational, the cord for the plug is short so be mindful of how your parking if you have a side charging port and be prepared to try multiple times as I had to switch between charging cords a couple times to make it work. I'll be back but that's because there's not a ton of options"

AWFUL CHARGING STATION. DO NOT GO HERE. Only 1 out of the 3 chargers here works properly (number 3) and even that one has issues occasionally. I’ve called electrify America 6 different times about this location over the last 6 months and they’ve done nothing about it. Charger number 1 has been unavailable for months and charger number 2 stops charging for no reason after 5 or so minutes and has done so for weeks. In my opinion it’s not even worth going to any of the EA south Jersey locations. I’ve been to almost all of them and alll of them are extremely unreliable.

I’ve called electrify America 6 different times about this location over the last 6 months and they’ve done nothing about it. Charger number 1 has been unavailable for months and charger number 2 stops charging for no reason after 5 or so minutes and has done so for weeks. In my opinion it’s not even worth going to any of the EA south Jersey locations. I’ve been to almost all of them and alll of them are extremely unreliable.
Works good although one of the screen blank but we charged it anyway and it worked.

"Of the two chargers in Center city, this is the best one. I would say if your in need of a quick charge come here. Their is the $5 garage fee but the kWh rate is generally cheaper for less an hour. You can shop at Target or DGx for groceries or grab a quick bit."

"It’s not overcrowded like Penrose , and never had to wait in line. Nice people too. As long as rates don’t go up, I come here."

It is well located. Unfortunately you it js in a pay-to-park garage that is not 24 hrs. The chargers work fine and there is always a spot to park. It is in the parking of Target.

SR+ will fully charge in about one hour. Make sure to keep an eye on the charging as you don’t want to stay longer as Tesla will make you pay for idle time.

Who the heck ever though of putting charging station on to a PAID parking garage?! It charges slowly even though I was the only one there (Tesla claims that more users make the charging slower....so promissed 170mil/ 1/2hour was only around 100miles/hour.... 1 HOUR IN GARAGE IS 5$

Great charging location. If charging at night you won’t have access to the restrooms inside HEB. There is a gas station and several fast food joints around that will take no more than a 3 minute drive from charger.

Two Superchargers that are tucked away from the main roads. We recharged our Model 3 there a couple of times with no problems. They are co-located outside a hotel so restrooms and a restaurant (Taco Palenque I believe) are available.

"Does not exist anymore! The Tesla destination chargers were replaced with JuiceBar chargers that use AmpUp to charge you. They have J1772 plugs and charge at 10kW. The current rate is $3/hour plus taxes, fees, and idle fees ($5/hour starting 30 minutes after charging finishes). Max allowed charging time is 4 hours. Then you have to go unplug and plug back in to start a new session. The NEMA 14-50 and NEMA 5-20 (120v) outlets are still there if you have your UMC on you. The two times I used the 14-50 outlets, I had to turn on the circuit breakers in the breaker panel not too far away. There are three charger plugs and three outlets of each that reach four parking spaces, although a couple of spots were usually ICE’d. I recommend bringing your J1772 adapter if you plan to use the charger, and also bringing your Mobile Connector with a 14-50 adapter if you don’t feel like going through the trouble of dealing with AmpUp and needing to reconnect after 4 hours."

Nice family stay at the HGI. I counted eight Tesla Chargers.
Most of time six or seven were iced. They all have Tesla signs marking them. Management needs to do more otherwise EV owners will go elsewhere.

This is the only non Tesla chargepoint station on the island unless you want to use a wall plug. It pumps out 7Kw so it's definitely not as slow as a wall plug. At those speeds plan on leaving your car here and taking the bus around the island to enjoy your day.

Great chargers only wish there was a 350kW
Great place to charge. Meijer and target within walking distance. Only downside is that no 350 chargers here only 150s. But I generally have enough time to finish my errands before hitting 80 percent that way.

"It's an older charging station so it was on the slower side. Then someone pulled in beside us and it really slowed us down. We were able to charge enough but what typically is only a 15 minute stop at other super chargers was a 30+ minute stop. There was a variety of shopping around so if you need to pass the time, there were options."

Terribly difficult to get to off the interstate. Many lights and in a busy Target / Meijer parking lot. Tucked in next to a large CCS charger. Cincinnati really needs additional supercharging options.

Meijer and Target both here for bathrooms and shopping. Not sure if it is the Tesla owners or the rest of the parking but it is normally filled with debris and other trash. Not too well lit if you go at night.

Great charging spot!
13 bays I think and all super fast We had no wait tonight. This station is located on right side of Meijer parking lot (go figure ) and it is easy to get in and out. The only downside is that Houston Road can get extremely congested so it may be difficult to get into Meijer parking lot at times. There is easy entrance to both 75 NORTH and SOUTH on Houston Road. Check out my charge rate and n the attached photo.

Roughly a 1/2 mile off the freeway in the Meijer grocery store parking lot. This station is on the very right side of the parking lot when facing the entrance of Meijer. There are several food options around and tons of shopping options nearby within a walking distance. Cell reception is solid on att with full bars on 5g. Restroom options are abundant although none are available after 10pm. There are plenty of grassy areas around for your pet to relieve themselve.

"It seems everyone hates this charging area due to parking fee. You get charge if stayed more than 60 minutes. I have a model S, and it is hard for me to reach the ticket. Lighting is good at night. It is covered so not much snow. It has 14 chargers with 150kw as of 01/23."

"Had been to Hard Rock casino superchargers last year when visiting the area. But, at that time there was no automated entrance and exit gates."

"It cost $15 to get access to the parking garage where the superchargers are located. There was a line of 6 cars waiting for an open charger. Cars kept coming in and sometimes ignored the line and snagged a charger after previous electric car backed out and was in front of the waiting line, the just arrived new car would take the charger, making the waiting time longer. With 16 miles left, I had to continue waiting."

"I was able to charge car finally, but the long wait caused the preconditioning to wear off and took longer!"

"Happy to be charged, but access to charger doubled cost for me. Not likely to visit the area again."

"Sadly, the car next to me did not care about their fellow Tesla owners, car was unplugged and blocking anyone else from using the space. Anyone aware of a way to report folks blocking usage?"

Cell service is really bad at this location so sitting in your car to read emails or watch videos and such on your phone or cars media is not an option as it buffers the entire time. Also there’s nothing around to occupy time that’s worthy of your time. The casino is smokey and dirty and there’s nothing in walking distance such as a target or grocery store to grab something quick and get back on the road. Also not the best neighborhood with a lot of transient foot traffic

"Stopped here to charge my Model Y LR. Coming for the day from Pacifica, CA. Just a few spaces (6), but very clean and I plugged into 1A and hallelujah, it's charging at 138kw. I was down to 50 miles and I'll be on my way in less than 1 hour. Meantime went to Save Mart to get some food! Perfect way to end a beautiful trip to Tahoe! Soooo Glad I went with a Tesla as their charging infrastructure is second to None! No range anxiety here!"

Conveniently located next to Lowes foods around the side in the shade (depending on the time of day.)
"Not a particularly busy charger, even for being off the interstate and in a heavily “Teslated” area (saw dozens of S3XY’s within a mile.) Maybe about half the stalls were in use the whole time."
Only downside was that it only kicked out 135KW despite preconditioning and not being particularly busy. Definitely not a true 250KW despite what Tesla maps might claim.

"Best and most reliable charging stations in the Mid Atlantic states. They weren't around just a few years ago, but have come on strong. Thanks to Sheetz for partnering with them and installing charging stations at strategic locations. No club membership needed since they have a credit card reader, although, once the reader did not work, so I was glad I signed up (you give them your credit card # then)."

"I honestly wish they just used the rest of the spots on this side that the stations are located cause it genuinely is annoying when large lifted pickup trucks and vans park right next to my car. And especially when they back into the spot. It seems very dangerous especially since it is located at a very popular entrance location of the Sheetz. Other than that, it is a great location."

250W chargers and we saw max 250 which is nice. Charged 18-80 in about 20 mins plus Sheets is a good place to grab a sandwich. Saw other reviews about slow charge but starting at 18% we saw full stated power so maybe they fixed something

"Decent location... right off I99 and I80, but poor charging speeds took me 60 min to charge up to 86 miles on my Model X. There is a liquor store, Weiss market (supermarket + beer shop) and Wendy’s nearby. It’s convenient for me to stop if I desperately need a charge. But it’s the only supercharger in the immediate area."

"This charging station is super convenient, is close to a real gas station and store, and a couple of restaurants. It's also very close to the highway, so you don't have to drive very far to get to it. And like all Tesla charging stations it's clean, efficient, and saves a lot of money over gasoline."

It's your typical EA in a Walmart parking lot. No food nearby. But the biggest issue is that it's very busy on weekends and has become a Rivian hotspot. There were 3 there today when I pulled up and another came later. We just need more EA locations in the Midwest so one busy one isn't a big deal.

Walmart and other shopping is walking distance and there is a pretty good Mexican restaurant just off the Walmart parking lot.

The worst supercharger I have yet used and I've used a lot. Inconvenient. Cramped. Pay after the first hour. Not even a V3 charger. No bathroom available. No food or drinks nearby. Dark and gloomy

Just all the worst things a supercharger could be.

Tesla really nailed the experience here as in every aspect of their vehicles.

"I've seen 2 different configurations of EA Charging Stations: diagonal parking spaces with chargers in-between the spaces, and straight-in spaces with chargers mounted at the head of each space. Diagonal works better for EVs with side-mounted charging ports, and straight-in for EVs with front or back ports. All have very heavy and inflexible cords that tend to stress the EV charging port. Cords should be more flexible and several feet longer."

Great location for charging…as long as you aren’t here in the morning since nothing is open. We ended up walking to the extended stay for a restroom. Otherwise it’s clean and lots to do while it charges.

"While the Charleston Place Hotel is simply magnificent, the super charger is 40 miles per hour charge. Love this 5.0!!! Hotel where the service is classic awesome."
"As previously mentioned, this is located in the Belmond Charleston Hotel valet area. There are only 2 Tesla chargers, one was out of order, and the other was being used.

"I've stopped here for a recharge about 6 times now during in-state road trips. Chargers/cables have always worked fine. If you are towing something like a trailer or camper behind your EV, know that these stations really weren't designed with that in mind and you will have a very hard time plugging in--it may not be possible without blocking a bunch of charging stations. Really hope fast chargers are constructed to be pull-through going forward for this reason."

"I have stopped at his charging station several times. On the last stop it would not recognize my car. The real plus was the Service Rep on the other end of the line. He answered all of my questions, reset the charging unit and got me on my way."

Clean. Glad we got another set of super chargers in pooler! That makes 3 now in the Savannah area. Keep it up Tesla doing great! Only gripe is there happens to be a dip right before the supercharger for drainage. If you have lowered your car be careful mine almost scraped. Just a heads up.

This is such a nice Supercharging station. Parker’s Store and area are clean and personnel are personal and helpful. Highly recommend it. Also food is good. Easy access from I95 even though you have to exit off onto I16.

This charger has a weird two wire connector underneath & cannot fit Tesla's. Very odd connector.

I rate this place a 4 because it’s confusing and annoying. The chargers are on the first floor of the parking lot. If you want to use the bathroom you have to go to the airport. It’s a bit of a walk compare to some places.
The bathroom are clean and are located on the first floor. When you leave you have to make sure you take your ticket to the person on the booth. So she can let you pass and you don’t pay for parking. But I much rather charge at other charger.

Tesla navigation did not lead me to the parking garage where the chargers are located. I drove around for a while until I could physically see the chargers but I couldn’t see a way into the parking garage other than going the wrong way on the one-way street. Which is what I chose to do.

"Since it’s an airport, there wasn’t anything to do, although there is a bathroom, and the information desk where you can get your ticket validated."

We love Tesla!
However this charging station is the hardest to find and is in the middle of nowhere!
By far the worst location!!!
Tesla also needs to add more than just backup stations they need some drive thru one for cars hauling trailers (pulling a trailer is not recommended as it drains the battery from 306 down to 90 miles)

"This Tesla Supercharger location was a little difficult to find but is actually a good location. It is on the lower level of a parking garage so it is covered. You have to enter the rental car gate, take a ticket and then charge vehicle. Upon exit, go to line on left with an attendant and they will not charge you any parking fee. This location has 8 bays and is busy. The spaces are tighter than usual as this space is at a premium."

"We are new Tesla drivers that being said...finding the physical stations once you get to the location is like playing ""Hide and Seek"" or ""Marco Polo"". When I say in completely random places is an understatement. Tesla does a great job at keeping you informed regarding your trip range and how much juice you'll once you get to your location; they need to do better with identifying locators (i.e. 2nd level parking structure, next to Wendy's, in the WAWA parking lot etc)"

2 tesla destination chargers. Facility is cheap for the general area as it was listed as $2 total for 5pm-5am and $1 per hr otherwise. Not a bad option relative to valet parking for hotels in area and obviously self funds parking fee relative to a supercharger (note: i was getting 8kwh on the tesla charger)

This place is not safe even during day time. Homeless people are just sleeping near the charging stations. One of the guys even rushed into the car to ask for money! I would recommend everyone to avoid this charging station if you are on a long trip. Place is just among no where. There is no security here. Charge at your own risk!

"No excuses!!! This is a well lit RIGHT OFF 95 charging station. The gas station, store and restaurant was all good...just the Tesla people littering...note how close the trashcan is to where they threw their garbage out...not cool!!! I had to step over a cup, 2 Chick-fil-A boxes and on the other side of my car to get my dog were 2 more Chick-fil-A boxes in tesla area...no other littering around the area!"

Loving these new V3 super chargers. Every spot was full but everyone was still getting Max power to get back on the road again. The little fueling station also has a pretty good selection of food and drinks

"Hands down has to be one of the worst charging station. Only works sometimes. Sometimes you have to try many different ways for it to turn: the app, evgo card, or credit card. Not even customer service can get this station to turn on. I can’t believe I got this charger to work today. I only stopped by because I was driving by. This charger doesn’t even get close to charging at 200 kw. The fastest it chargers at is 46 kw."

Conveniently located around the side of the Wawa. Plenty of space between chargers. Easy to move your car when charging is complete.

We call the help number, they confirm both chargers were ""under maintenance"" and wouldn't work. Of course, that information is nowhere on the machines when you look at them and certainly not broadcasted out so you don't plan your entire trip/route around them. The worst. 0/0. Would not recommend. At 10:57pm: off to find a different charger."

"Pretty convenient location for a charging station in Norfolk, especially since options are limited. Take a quick break, grab a bite to eat and log into the wifi at Panera Bread or Qdoba across the street, maybe stroll through the Walmart next door and get a few groceries. Even a Bounce House for your antsy kids! I tend to pass by this station often since it's right off of I-64 and it's rare for me to see more than two cars plugged in at a time since there aren't many people with electric cars around here. With up to six superchargers available 24/7, I'm fairly certain you'll be able to get a spot here to charge."

"These chargers are horrible!!! The touch screens are extremely hard to use. I tried touching soft and then hard would not work. I don’t understand for these chargers being so new, that they don’t work better. Why don’t the machines charge faster. Man Evgo is the worst!!! I dislike this company. I really don’t like that this is my my only option. Something needs change. Costume services is the worst."

Great super charger..wish it was near Towne center
"Expensive - they charge $0.50/minute for time on the charger (aka parking) above the electricity charge. We got 60 miles for $5 but paid $10 for parking. We used as a guest. Otherwise it was clean, safe, easy to access and beside the main office - see photo attached taken from beside the charger."

"Only use in a pinch, they charge a ridiculous .50 cents per minute parking fee while charging which comes out to about .80 cents a kwh to charge. The charged parking fee is for parking at a curb in a free parking space in customer lot."

This would be the first time we would need a charging station for the car for this long distant trip. We arrived there was somebody already charging on another station and so we used (Roger) since we have never used a charger from this company we kept getting a "Failure Notice" so we thought it was something we did. After many tries and help from others charging we called the company. They said that one was broke! So why wasn't there a sign on the machine saying this.. or better yet fix it. After 30 minutes we were able to charge on the other charger.

"This would be part of a discussion that people would have about having an all electric vehicle and the problem with being able to charge the vehicle. One of the drivers we talked to said there are 8 new stations at Pembroke Square, which we used later that night since it was closer on our way back to Spotsylvania, VA. (I also posted a review)."

I am still giving them a 4 star review because we were still able to charge the vehicle but it needs to be fixed in the very near future.

Not impressed!! 250 miles charge per hour. Not good for a 250 KW charger!!!!! That’s really slow as in about 100 kw slow! I was in slot A with nobody else using It either. Terrible……
The people that use Tesla supercharger must be some kind of lazy because the garbage can is like 10 ft away But they rather litter then throw it away. Should we cleaning up after yourself? Not the Wawa people. It's not fair to them. Just my opinion. I know some people just throw stuff away but not all

Located within the Wawa parking lot. Easy access from the road. A little slower than the said 250KW. We used this at night before we checked in at our hotel which was only 1.6 miles away. Fairly safe and well lit. The Wawa has bathrooms and a quick bite to eat if needed.

4 charging spots. Worked perfectly.
"It’s very nice that they have a free station, however one of the chargers has been broken for a year. It doesn’t seem as if there is any intention to fix it."

Good location for charging. There's a super market nearby with a cafe that has good coffee. Plenty of food and other services nearby but not right at the charger.

Pizza and nice grocery store nearby!
Only 50 kW
Redirected to this charger because less busy than Burlington a little further. Arrived with 15% battery and charge at 211kw on my model 3. A store for healthy and quality lunches right next door. No complaints

There is 1 Chademo charger. It works well. The only thing I didn't like is there's an idle fee that occurs after 10 minutes but that also prevents someone from staying too long.

"I have used this station a few times now and there are usually spots to choose from. I have never had a problem charging, and it was able to provide the full charging speed my ID.4 could take. Not sure what the other review ""Small not that good"" means. Is it not good because there are only 3 stations there? They may add more if they find they are all busy too much of the time."

Where do you get that electric power from to charge your car
Three charging spots. Conveniently located near I-205. Target is nearby and so is Clackamas Town Center.

This is a new station and the chargers are constantly down. This is a very busy area and I don't understand why Electrify America can't keep it's equipment in top running shape.

"The PGE Electric Avenue chargers are always the best ones to use in terms of reliability. These chargers are no exception. Worked great and was fast enough for me. I wish there were more Electric Avenues within all of PGE's service area, because they seem much more reliable than Electrify America's chargers, especially for CHAdeMO charging."

"ALSO, if you own a Tesla (like my Model 3) you need an adapter sold by Tesla to use the DC fast chargers at this location."

"There are 4 CHAdeMO/CCS fast chargers and 2 J1772 chargers here. Charging is limited to two-hour session but you don't need to pay to park here as long as you're charging. The location is great, right next to the farmers market and downtown Milwaukie. Pay with credit card or use a Greenslots account to initiate charge (the stickers on the chargers are wrong, don't use the chargeway app)."

Nice spot to spend a few minutes charging. Nice places to visit in walking distance. Go skip stones across the street at the park or pop in to Things from another world comics shop. Get a selfie in front of Dark Horse comics HQ. The charging station got four stars because one of the screens was not working. Other than that safe and clean place to charge with trash cans and restrooms near by.

"Weird, we tried to use the charger for our E-Golf but neither the “Blue” or the “Green” fit. The E-Golf uses the same charger type as a Leaf and a ThinkCity. The PGE charger has a rubber bar shaped thing under the plug in part that makes it impossible to plug in. No wonder no one was using the chargers."
Chargers are mislabeled in the app but all of them put out 50 kilowatts

"Saved my butt today. They've got two chargers for my older chevy spark. Longer charge time for the lower power smaller station, but a guaranteed charge nonetheless. My 2 hours was only $3 and it would have only been that price for even longer."
Using the app is the best way to do it all! You can pay for a balance or do a subscription (I will be doing this).
Thankful for PGE and Shell partnering for this station. I'd prefer they replace the other more expensive locations or at least be in addition to those other locations (way more expensive but possibly a faster charge?) Idk if they even support charging my 2014 chevy spark.

"Awesome charging station. Great location right off the interstate with easy access for commuters, and the cost is cheap as long as you need more than 10-15 kWH of charge."

"Unfortunately these are set up with diagonal parking, with the station at the end of the stall (instead of next to your car) which makes it difficult connect if you don't have a front-facing connector. I suggest backing in, instead of trying to reach the connector back to your port, as the cables on these chargers are super short."

Have been to this station 3 different times and lately I have not been able to get a full charge. The station seems to stop at 5 minutes and freezes up. Called customer service had issues with them also.

"Gasoline is about 3x cheaper than any charging station this company has to offer. On top of their almost disrespectful cost to charge their station did not charge to 100% and then charged me an idle fee of 15 dollars. The first time it did not fully charge I thought it was just not enough time, third time is the charm, cannot recommend this company to anyone, will never be using again. Absolutely appalling"

"One of the chargers was faulty at this location, I had to return and use the second connection at the station. Once I got charging I had to leave on a not full charge. Next day I had a message from blink saying my charge was complete, which meant the session doesn't end when putting the power connector back in the cradle. Soo I paid to charge someone else's EV.. Contacted Blink Customer team and a month later still no response. Trash hardware and support!"

"Great clean location with brand new chargers frequented by ghetto, trashy Tesla owners/renters/Uber drivers. It’s a shame Tivoli security is not handing out citations and banning offenders."

I myself drive full time with Uber. I live down the street and come here daily at night only to find pee bottles and fast food bags directly in the parking spots. I can only assume most of the trash is left behind by the same peasants that leave pee bottles and fast food bags at the Uber/Lyft airport staging lot.

"OH AND BTW, some of the cables facing the apartment complex wall are not long enough. The concrete/rubber stoppers prevent the cars for backing in all the way to reach the cables."

"This the worst supercharger I’ve been to, people are super inconsiderate here. In my opinion, if you’re going to be at a supercharger and not stay in your car it defeats the purpose of it as other need to use it. The whole point of a supercharger is be a quick charge and then be done so the next person may use it. Leaving your car camping at one just takes away from the people who actually need it in a pinch. If you’re going to leave for a long period of time and explore Tivoli Village do everyone a favor and take the slower supercharger so those who actually just need a quick charge may use it."

"The bulk of fast charges are still unavailable. I had to wait for one of the two fast chargers at the front of Tivoli, right off Rampart. It was one of those days I didn’t plug my car in at night, so I needed to rely on a quick charger. I would have picked another location. From my car when I selected fast charging locations, it showed 4 available, but to me that’s false when it’s accounting for the slower chargers."

Your Charging station was clean and available when I arrived it was very fast charging as it took Just over an hour To fully charge From 15%. Your station was the best for charging! I give 4 stars because we had to call customer service To enter our credit card manually Because the machine failed Twice. I think It's an issue with Polestar 2 vehicle more than the charging station as we used several and had the same issue until we called customer service each time. The car is outstanding!

"Great charging station easy to use and the touch screen was a nice addition. First time charging was a success. The only drawback is that the line for the regular gas station lines up directly in front of the EV stations. Backing in while in front of all the gas station line was awkward. It was a painful reminder of how rude people are, even when trying to exit after charging was complete they still assumed I was trying to take their spot in line. If the area for charging was easier to enter and exit I definitely would upgrade to 5 stars."

It was a painful reminder of how rude people are, even when trying to exit after charging was complete they still assumed I was trying to take their spot in line. If the area for charging was easier to enter and exit I definitely would upgrade to 5 stars."

"I was happy to see they had a CHAdeMO charger, but when I attempted to start a charge with it on my car, it would start for a split second, then stop and say “charging error, reconnect and continue to start over”. To their credit I called the number for assistance and a nice lady answered and helped me the first time, but any attempts I would try after that would do the same thing. Other than my inconvenience this place seems like a great spot for others to charge up."

The charging stations have a max output of 150 kw instead of the 350 kw you would expect from this type of location. Most of the parking spots are full from ICE vehicles and it doesn’t seem like they care to report them at all. Location was clean and there is an entrance to Caesar’s Palace forum shops steps away allowing you to shop or eat while charging.

This is the worst charging station I have been to. We waited 1.5 hours to charge for 25 mins. Most of the stalls were taken up by cars done charging already and just leaving car unattended. I found one spot where the car wasn't even plugged in and security did end up giving it a citation. They are trying to manage the situation but overall bad experience

"This is a great supercharger location. Close to the strip, easy to access with a pin available inside your car or by pressing the ""call"" button at the gate. You also get the added advantages of being near two hotel entrances (the Flamingo and Hilton Grande Vacation), the monorail and getting to watch people take videos and photos of their car for the likes."

"Nice setup in the middle of the strip. V3 is so fast! You do need to press the assistance button to gain entry to the lot. You then get a code to get a parking tag good for 1 hour free, and they charge parking after that. It only took about 35 minutes for me to go from 15-80%"

#1 rule: don't block the road.

I saw a queue of cars trying to get into the station because someone didn't know the PIN. Everyone else was blocking cross traffic. Please don't do that.

"The PIN is on your center console when you click the location details. First hour is free. I like it, it keeps people from staying longer than they need."

The exit is diagonal from the entrance. It's in the back left corner when you enter.

"It's a very convenient location with lots of shops within walking distance for food and to kill time. Restrooms available too, but you'll need to talk a couple minutes."

The station has solar panels that shade the car. The location is clean and feels safe.

It was good and it took about 40 minutes to go from 20% to 80%. It was charging at 58kw. Not bad but I would think Athens GA would have a lot more chargers for being a progressive town.

Please build more charging stations in more locations! EV's are the future!

"I commute from Eureka to Rolla for school and rely on this charger to get to class and back home. I've had my fair share of difficulties with charging sessions not starting, but recently that hasn't happened. This morning I had to call electrify america since the chargers weren't working, and I've never dealt with more polite and helpful customer service. The woman I spoke with was very pleasant and quickly had my problem fixed. What really made the difference though, is that she was much more concerned with my being able to charge and get where I was going than the problem with the charger. Besides that I save a ton of money by being a member, and their app is fantastic."

This morning I had to call electrify america since the chargers weren't working, and I've never dealt with more polite and helpful customer service. The woman I spoke with was very pleasant and quickly had my problem fixed. What really made the difference though, is that she was much more concerned with my being able to charge and get where I was going than the problem with the charger. Besides that I save a ton of money by being a member, and their app is fantastic."

"This is my favorite Tesla charging station so far! Cross the road to the Baymont hotel, walk to the back, and there are stairs down to the concrete path around Blue Lake. It takes about 20 minutes to walk all the way around the lake, and by then you should be most of the way charged. Great stop!"

Charger worked great and plenty of open stalls. Conveniently off the highway but not many options nearby for things to do while you charge (just one restaurant that wasn't open at the time)

"oh wow, both 350 kW are giving me a maximum of 17kW… (limited by the charging station it says)"
that’s 37 miles an hour when i usually get 450 miles an hour. *sigh*
"i’ve put close to 4,000 miles in the past 8 days, walmart’s charging stations always have something junky about them."

Dude your charging cables are so short we can't hardly plug in on #3 and the others don't really get above 70 kW charging speeds despite saying 350. #3 gets up to 200 which is good.

"I am writing this review on October 2022. I am a regular customer. Out of the 4 stations at this location, only 1 station is working and the kwh has been reduced to less than 50 kwh in a 350 Kwh station. Expect to wait 2-3 hours for a complete charge. To be noted, this is the only EF America location in Naples/Marco Island and Bonita neighborhood. Horrible experience."

Not typically a busy charge station. Covered in a free parking garage which is nice to evade the FL sun. Lots of little shops and places to eat within walking distance if you should choose. Cell service is so so

Inside a garage and close to high end shops. I was lucky to find an empty spot. The rest seem to be occupied past their charge limit and no drivers. $60/hr parking in a shade for people that are paying $500 for a $20 purse not enough to get them to move their cars.
Its not a bad place just might be full.

Most all the Tesla cars here are parked full time and make it difficult to find an empty space. It appears Tesla is not charging them after they have fully charged. Not a good thing!

"Found this very large Tesla charging station at the outlet mall. It’s conveniently located just east of I 75. It’s an outlet mall so it does have some restaurants, subway, hamburger joints, Starbucks etc. But I don’t know if they’re open at night, I don’t think so. Anyway this station has 16 250 kW superchargers and 16 level 2 Tesla chargers. I have never seen a charging station with this many chargers. I think it’s only been open a few months. I don’t think you’ll have any problem with wait times here."

The station being on the top floor of the garage and with no visible signs on the bottom makes finding this place not obvious for 1st-mers. There were two slots open but one of them had a physically broken station which should have been fixed or marked as broken before I parked next to it.

These are NOT free ChargePoint chargers. Plan on spending at least $1. There’s mosquitoes everywhere. And from the looks of it these spots are frequently ICE’d. There’s other places to charge for free nearby.

"Only one charging station for my type of vehicle, worthless, useless, utterly garbage.. sitting here now waiting on another person to finish. Why is there 5 other ports, but only one of the one I need."

Off-peak prices have increased more than 50% at most Bay Area Superchargers. There is no longer any incentive to charge when it has less of an impact to the grid. Elon must need every last cent towards the next earnings call.
Busy but location is near to Brane nobles where I went to coffee shop and read book for an hour. Great to pass an hour during charging.

Could not charge here. All parking stalls repaved and restriped; no EV stalls anymore so no way to get car next to a charger. Might as well rip these old chargers out.

Chargers 1 and 3 charge great but charger 2…. Only reached a max of 40 kw so if you are unlucky enough to get that one you will be here a looong time. It has been this way for a few months now. Just a heads up so you can find another charger if that’s the only available option!

Chargers seem to be valid 250kW; I get the full charging rate (over 1000MPH) when I arrive with a battery below 20% and pre-conditioned (warmed). I think some folks just don't understand how charging speed depends on state of the battery (state of charge and temperature) or how chargers are paired (A&B). Decent amenities at the shopping center.

Spot on the left of the Tesla is a disabled spot, so was definitely not going to park there.

There's really only 1 charging station that works. #2 has been broken for months and the 3 station had 2 hookups but never works right and is set at an angle which means you have to park on an angle to work... so the second connection is meaningless.

"So because there is only 1 charger which is accessible and that works, it's ALWAYS taken during daylight hours."

"$0.34 per kwhr as of 9/22/2022, which is one of cheapest rates on the I-95 corridor currently. Only downside is that Cracker Barrel is only food in walking distance, if only want a snack. But plenty empty chargers so should not have idle chargers if want a full meal"

"Located off Exit 79 of I-95. Supercharger are on the southwest side of the Hampton Inn parking lot. The location is about 2 miles from the I-95 and I-40 interchange. After charging, when approaching the first stop light intersection (S Walton and 50/242) you’ll want to be in the left left turn lane so that you’ll be ready for the left turn onto the on-ramp for southbound I-95 after crossing over bridge. If you’ll be continuing north on I-95 or either direction on I-40 you’ll want to head through the intersection since S Walton Dr feeds directly into the on-ramp for northbound I-95."

In the actual shopping center there are a bunch of vacant buildings, a dollar mart, a family dollar, BMV, and a bunch of random businesses like hair salons and a vet. Went to the Family Dollar and it looked like a tornado had gone through the place, but that seemed normal to the employees."

"Chargers are frequently down. There often language barriers with the customer service reps. The ports often indicate that they are working and upon arrival they are not. Time is wasted going back and forth to chargers that are supposed to be working that are not. Several of the reps are wonderful to work with.

"Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Fuel City in Dallas, Texas, for a Tesla charging session. To my delight, the location offered fast Tesla Superchargers and, surprisingly, a group of friendly longhorns nearby. These charming animals added a unique and memorable touch to the charging experience."

"Upon arriving at the side of the gas station, I was immediately greeted by the longhorns who seemed quite curious about the Tesla charging process. Their presence made for a pleasant and entertaining visit as my vehicle charged. I arrived at around 5:40 PM, and fortunately, I didn't encounter any panhandlers or safety concerns during my visit. However, I would exercise caution when visiting the area at night."

"Overall, Fuel City offers a truly ""neat"" experience for Tesla owners looking to charge their vehicles while enjoying the company of some adorable longhorns. It's definitely a one-of-a-kind spot that makes for a memorable and enjoyable visit."

Wouldn’t advice to go here at night. The place is secluded and is located next to a farm area. Lots of mosquitos and other insects around the area. Also the place is a little scary if around evenings.

37 minutes of charging took MYP from 22% to 91% at $18.45 cost after taxes. Averages out to ~$0.36 per kWh assuming 75kWh usable. Charging stats below.

BP next door is shady - no price tags on anything so be prepared to spend $5 on a Gatorade.

Great charging hub with options for a variety of cars. Near a gas station with free restrooms and several restaurants.

Fun to see it ramp-up over 1k mi/hr for a spell. Fast. Convenient. Available.
Excellent placement! Congratulations to MGE for bringing the future to life.
Most work most of the time but since it's the only electrify America station in Madison 3 of 4 working charging stations is just not enough.

Update: now 2 of four connections are 350kw. One chademo at 50kw max. Doesn't state that they are balanced stations but have only been getting 150kw max during winter even with battery pre-conditioning.

We arrived at 1 p.m. on a Friday to a complete frenzy. There were people literally fighting over the 4 charge stations they have. So much that a guy came to us yelling that he had been waiting half an hour and we were taking his spot but we saw him pull in after us. Something needs to be done about this because there are more and more electric vehicles being purchased but not enough stations available. We have been to this location before at night and not had an issue but when it is an issue it isn't good. They could at least have a waiting area that's numbered for people to stage in so that it isn't a compete mess when someone leaves a station and everyone decides they want it first. It gets quite nasty what some people will do to cut in front of one another. There were only 3 of the 4 stations working and one guy sat on hold with Electrify America the entire time trying to get assistance. There were also people trying to plug into a station already in use so it was ending charges for the others. I have since read that only one charge can be used at a time per station and this may be useful to have it posted somewhere so others know this as well and not try to use the second plug.

Four 350kw chargers in the Walmart parking lot about 1mi off the Interstate. When I arrived at 6pm on a workday Monday they were all available. My vehicle maxes at 150kw and reported charging at 149kw. Great place to stop on way to or from Milwaukee.

"Sometimes one charger might not work, but consistently there is availability"
Does what it should and plenty of restaurants and stores to spend time in. Has been a dependable location for charging.

Used this charger a couple weeks ago. Plenty of stalls and I maxed out at 261kW before dropping down to 170kW once my battery percent got higher. Plan to stop here again on future road trips!

"Even next to another car charging, got up to 160kW but used it during a road trip so it was hot enough to take that much juice. Hy-Vee restrooms are north side of the building near bakery (opposite side building from pharmacy). The chargers are located away from the store entrance making it likely to remain available. Clean restrooms."

Lots of stations and a very handy midsized grocery store next to it.

Two Tesla specific chargers and three other EV chargers. Speed 40 miles per charging hour. Two of the 5 were ICE'd but it didn't matter so we didnt complain. Wish spaces were a little bit wider. It was tight squeeze. Hotel is nice. Elevators go from parking to room.

"This place is better than the 3-stall station at the Mall. It has more stalls and the grocery store means food and restrooms. The hours of operation are better, too."

Only down side is that this is the closest to the interstate and has the slow charging speed of 150KW. Shopping in the parking lot which is nice.

Busy location but so is the one at the mall. Definitely need more chargers on the east side of Madison - only reason for 4 stars. Otherwise safe enough location with the grocery store right there.

"I wish this were closer to the interstate, but it's awesome that it's attached to a Hy-Vee that is open 24 hours. The store has a great selection and easy access to restrooms. There are always a few free stalls for charging and they're usually pretty darn fast. Kind of surprised to see Green Cab there, though. I had thought commercial vehicles were not allowed to use Superchargers. I won't complain, since it wasn't near full, though."

Tons to do while charging. Great place to stop if heading to northern Wisconsin. I gave it 4 stars because it only has 3 plugs. It’s the first 3 plug I have seen. Normally I see 5-6 at a Supercharger. But it’s a great location.

Today I did my first “big” trip in my Tesla model 3 and found this charging station to be a bit off the beaten path. It’s located behind a Weis grocery store. I’m not sure I would like to be back here by myself in the evening.
But the chargers work fine. When I pulled up there was 3 other cars already charging so I felt safe.

"Tried to charge at Glenwood Kroger yesterday. The Charge Point chargers need servicing! Only one slow charger actually works, and was being used by a woman who kindly told me not to use the fast charger as it got stuck in the last person's car. It was indeed cracked and in bad condition. The slow charger next to it wouldn't fit my Nissan Leaf, and the only other one that would normally fit would not release from it's housing. As a result I couldn't charge and may not make it to my destination this am. Who can we contact when the chargers need repair?"

"I don't own a Tesla or need a super charger but they seem and look excellent! Every time I see them, I can't help but look. Nice and I see people using them. If I ever buy a Tesla and use the Supercharger, I will update my review. I'm basing this on what I have observed with other customers. They seem happy with it."

"It worked great as far as giving me a strong signal, but it caused my phone to use it and my plan minutes from my phone provider simultaneously. I had to switch my phone directly back to the router to fix my problem. So even though the device worked, i know my phone (Android) is brand new and works great with wi-fi, just not with the supercharger."

"When I'm here, I'm usually the only Tesla charging at a very busy WaWa. More often than not, ICE drivers stop to ask me curious questions (how long does it take to charge? how far can you go on a charge?). People are VERY friendly. WaWa has extra clean restrooms, fresh sandwiches, etc. There's also a Total Wines liquor store nearby, and a Home Depot."

"Listen, I'm not mad at this Tesla Supercharger. I'm just disappointed. I think this electric vehicle charging station gets an undeserved reputation because of the company it keeps. A Wawa? A KFC/Taco Bell? Most of the other Tesla Supercharger stations are far more successful, living on their own, starting families and making other little electric vehicle charging stations."

I am giving this Tesla Supercharger three stars because it can only go as far as its dreams allow. There is still so much time to grow and improve. Don't give up on this Tesla Supercharger. It won't give up on you.

Love the Wawa superchargers. Wednesday 3 pm. No other cars here. Started out fast at 150wH but then slowed down to 70-75. Watched a show in Netflix while we waited to get to 80%. Maybe we weren’t preconditioned enough.

This thing kind of sucked. The app is not very good and it's actually quite expensive. I can fill up my battery at others for about a dollar but I paid 2 something here and it wasn't full. Also a couple of them were broken.

Overall experience in one word: Pathetic
"There are a total of 8 charging plugs, 6 of them are low power and 2 of them are 50kw with exclusive tesla plug."
"When I tried to charge with low powered plug, it didn't work, guess I have to register, so installed the android app, completed the registration and right after that I'm not able to login in the same app,"
"So, I used chrome to login (yes it worked from website but app) and tried to charged, guess what, surprise ! All 6/6 low power plugs are not functional. There is no way to know unless you check the website."

"So, I moved to 50kw charge port, it charges you 0.3$/min, too expensive, just for 4% of my model 3 LR, (4kw use) it costed me 1.95$ which is not acceptable as it charges based on time not on kw consumed, (coz, after 80% charging speed will be slow on tesla) so you'd be paying more likely 2x of super charging cost."
The speed is not even 1/2x of supercharger but costs you much more.

"FYI, I have used volta free charging in lots of places, you just go there and plug it in and that's it. EVgo is pathetic, app login doesn't work is itself an indication of how bad their design is."

Never ever charging again at EVgo.

Just wish these stations had trash cans?? Like a gas station?
Most of them are always broken. The only way to get the one to charge is to literally hold or prop up the charging cable so it doesn’t unclick from your vehicle. Really hope they figure these out because it’s a bummer for those of us getting our first electric cars.

Never more than two cars at all of them."

The charging station is in the parking garage on level P2. There is one fast charger and several level 2 chargers. The negative is that you have to pay for expensive parking just to be able to charge.

It seems that this charger has been switched out.
It’s a ChargePoint now.
STILL NOT a Tesla station.
Not found at this point. There is a municipal charging point at the next parking lot. It is required to download an APP. The speed is like 20mi/hour. At least it is working. It enables the standard version model 3 travel around White Sand National Park. Hope this review help you find the charging spot.

Incorrect location and charger type. A local pointed me to the ChagePoint station that is within sight of this spot; and it’s in another parking lot. There are no Tesla stations downtown.

Good services!
Both spots are always filled with ICE cars. Spoke with security several times and the only policy is to try contacting the vehicle owner. LAS CRUCES! TICKET OR TOW! That’s the solution.

I would have preferred the higher power Tesla charger that used to be here but I’m still happy this ChargePoint exists. Stopped for dinner at a nearby restaurant while I charged.

They have 7 total Tesla destination chargers here!!! They are all around the building. No immediate restaurants nearby but are close enough to walk to so you can charge and get to White Sands National Park and back!!!

"There are indeed multiple chargers here. The price is $0.2/kWh. This is a great stop to ease some range anxiety due to potential crosswinds before heading to Deming, Truth or Consequences, or El Paso for Superchargers depending on your route. We charged to 99% at El Paso in the morning to head for White Sands. We arrived here with 35%. There are bathrooms inside the building on the 2nd floor as well as a free public WiFi network."

"It’s tricky to find , but look at the pictures of building it might can help you . Name of building is 166 Green office. But one only one is working, in same building there is another single charging station in corner."
It’s pretty slow but good to charge little bit to continue trip

Charge rate was 35 mi/hr for my model 3. Stopped to top off before heading down to El Paso Supercharger location. Las Cruces desperately needs a Tesla Supercharger!!!

This was a very convenient clean and nice hotel with plenty of room to charge up a vehicle. Next time I will stay at this hotel because the manager said that it’s free for the people that are registered guests.

"I really like this spot for charging. It's the best spot view wise, and who doesn't like free charging? I also enjoy the fact that these 2 dedicated parking spaces have the best view when the city sponsors great activities here in downtown. You are also close to a variety restaurants and stores so you can wander around while your car gets charged. BTW there's no posted time limit to stay in these 2 charging spots as opposed to the City Hall/Library charging spot. The Tesla dedicated charger offers 38-40 miles an hr. I really hate to give this place 4 stars because I love this location! But....there's a lot people that can't read the sign that says these 2 parking spots are for Electric Vehicles Only While Charging. I've come several times to find Gas cars park there."

Right off the freeway. Easy to get to. Right in the Rudy’s bbq parking lot. The Rudy's is clutch and if that's not what you want there are several walkable fast food places. Good cell reception with 5g (att) and full bars. Meets expectations on a supercharger near a big city.

Convenient with multiple charging station. Next to I-10 interstate freeway and usually not that busy. Next to few hotels and restaurants. My favorite restaurant is Rudy’s country style BBQ. You can actually see your car charging from the window while having food.

The chargers that I would find either broken or not in operation status! When I did find one, it took forever to charge (8kw)! Tesla, you need to a better job placing a charger station in a high population outside the major cities! Because your low range tesla's can't make it to every charger if they are not in range of 225 miles!"

"This station is terrible. Almost all of the chargers are non-functional and have been for over three months. I have called electrify America multiple times, and every time I'm here there's ALWAYS someone on the phone with customer service. At this point they know they're broken and in over three months have done nothing to service the station. I can't believe they would leave the only station in El Paso on the I-10 corridor broken for so long. Electrify America isn't displaying the dependability the electric car grid needs for broader acceptance and adoption."

"Eight superchargers available in the back of the Holiday Inn parking lot. We used stall 2A and got 250+ mi/hr for a charge rate. Easy access from I-25. Restrooms in hotel. Not a lot of food/ drink offerings in the area, but understand it is TorC after all. Worked great."

8Jan2020 Stopped at my favorite Store Charger in TorC! Stall 4A have is a charger of 320 mi/hr for a bit. One other Tesla S sharing the chargers. Worked great.

"I love stopping here a getting a free charge in our VW ID4. Works great, most of the time. I just hope they install many more. As more people start driving ev's its going to become a problem."
Update: Still using at least once a week to take advantage of the free juice. Usually works with no issues. Fun to talk to other EV owners when they are also there. Which is becoming more often.

"Fastest EV chargers in the Omaha metro area by a long shot, but of course your car must support the fast speeds to take full advantage; mine tops out at around 4 mi/min. The area is conveniently located near many areas to shop and eat. I do wish it was a little more centrally located, or that another Wal-Mart closer to the interior of Omaha would install these."

"I connected to a chademo rapid charger at 4:08 yesterday, the charger immediately malfunctioned (charger error 34) and locked itself to my car. After an hour on the phone with tech support they agree to dispatch a tech, I am asked to wait at my vehicle (this is 5:30) At 6:30 they call back and say they have been unable to find a tech but are still looking, at 7:30 they call and say a tech will arrive in 2 and a half hours. At 9:30 they call and say it will be at least another hour. Keep in mind it's January in Nebraksa and now rolling into evening. What turned into a stop for a quick 20 minute charge has now become a 6 hour ordeal, and I'm not in the middle of nowhere, I'm in Omaha Nebraska, the largest metro area for several hundred miles. Each time I spoke to tech support it was clear they had no idea what was happening, or didn't want to tell me, lots of I can't disclose that information. It became clear the person I had been speaking to all night did not actually dispatch the tech and was not actually communicating with the tech, she was desperately trying to help but also seemed to solidly have her hands tied behind some really truly awful costumer service policies. Tech finally arrived just after 10:30, at this point I had been stuck for nearly 6 and a half hours, I didn't get home until just after midnight. So, know, this is a risk you take when you plug into one of these devices, are you prepared to be stuck for 7 plus hours to get that quick charge?"

"This is my favorite CCS charger in the city right now, and thanks to Metro Community College for making it (and the four level 2 plugs) free to use. I'm charging at 4 mi/min, which is the fastest I've seen in the Omaha area so far that isn't Electrify America."

"Two fast (and free!) CCS chargers is like a dream come true, but while I haven't been here during the day to test this, both Maps and the ChargePoint app list these as only being open starting at 8pm. Since there is one charger at the entrance and exit to the service department, I have to imagine that this is to prevent public usage during business hours. Unfortunate for people from out of town who are traveling through the area during the day, but for people who live here, it's not too much of an inconvenience to visit at night, and there is another CCS charger at Cabela's down the road (though it isn't free)."

"Really wanted to rate this four stars due to the weird hours, but decided you really can't beat the price."

Conveniently located in the Cabela’s parking lot this charging station will be able to handle anything from regular charging too fast charging. The rapid charging station has two ports and you can park on either side of the station. The smaller of the two stations which is a regular or slower charger also has to ports that you can plug into. One port is being used you can always park next to it or in front of it on the opposite side for convenience. They are open 24/7 And except most if not all credit cards or debit cards. If you’re in the area and you need a quick boost than this will be a good spot that is safe and convenient.

"Charger works great, nobody here when I got here (4:30am), and slightly sketchy location at night (behind TJ Maxx). The main downside: there's no trash or restrooms available off hours. I'm sure during the day you could pop into TJ Maxx to use the bathroom and kill some time though."

It's the only Supercharger around. The lot usually gets cleared fairly quickly during snow. There is a weird dip in one portion of the lot that should probably get fixed. I think it is where they ran the power lines.

Very very bad. These chargers compare to Tesla are dinosaurs. 46 kw/h :( The outside temperature is 55°F. The worst part is that they know about the problem but do not move a finger to solve it.

"Also the plugs are CCS type 1 plug, but at $0.43 / kWh it is cheaper to operate an ICE car."

They have 250 and 150 kw of charge your choice and it's a big charge station well lit and safe there it's in Meyers parking lot but that is the only one that's close to Joliet Tesla have to build a few of them in Joliet!!!
"Bolingbrook now has V3 supercharging! The original 8, on the left, are v2 but the 8 new additions, on the right, are v3. V3 supercharging can charge at speeds up to 1000 miles/hour! Keep in mind that these speeds are only available when the batteries are very low (0-15%) and then starts to taper down after that."
"Only 4 stars because I think they are charging more money for v3, but I haven't confirmed this yet."

"This is one of the best Supercharger locations there's plenty of accommodations nearby Meier's, Chipotle, IHOP, Five Guys. When you enter the area there's a Starbucks and up the street is a Macy's."

"All stations operating at low power when I was there, and for the other two EVs that showed up later. Was only pulling 33 kW on a 150 kW with a preconditioned battery. The screen went dark and it didn't end my session after unplugging so I had to call customer service. Now customer service was very nice and helpful and did not charge me for the poor experience so I bumped it up a star for that. The Target at this location is also nice, there's a Subway you can walk to and it's not far from the highway, so if it worked well this would be a really great place to charge."

Nice 150kWH CCS Combo charging option. The charger did not get above 75kWh but the cost was fair.

Not one of these is working. So frustrating!!
Good charging experience. Kind of close to Target entrance so lots of parking lot traffic.

I am in a rental and chose the fun to drive Polestar 2 (thank you Enterprise). Only down side is super slow charging at home. I found this charging station and went there in the cold. Of the 4 stations there only one had the credit card reader working.
I had to call in a payment to their customer service team to be able to use the service which was easy but I did not like sharing that info over the phone.
I found this issue with both Oswego and Aurora locations. Please fix your stations!
Charging speeds were great and we got to shop while waiting. If I had this for a while I would sign up with them for the cheaper rates.

Great charging station - nice gas station facilities nearby with free vacuums to clean your car.

Charging station used to be free for 30 minutes and not are only free for 10 minutes but still a quality charge. Price is about $.33 /kwh

I had an excellent experience charging at the Tesla Super charger. It is a safe secure area surrounded by plenty of restaurants. A PDQ and a chinese restaurant were a few feet away. A Home 2 suites by Hilton was also a stones throw away. It took about 45 min to fully charge the Tesla. There were 12 brand new charging stations. The area is clean and free of debris. There was only one other Tesla there charging at the time and they were finished moments after I began charging. We exchanged a friendly wave. Tesla love.

This is a clean and sparsely attended Supercharger and frankly I prefer the charging station at a dealership nearby which I used with my BMW i3. But upon purchasing a Tesla I found that the CCS1 adaptor did not yet work with my 2019 Model 3. It is supposed to be enabled soon and I have written Tesla without any luck thus far; The message says "early 2023" and as I write this it is "early 2023"

Works great and connects seemlesly via plug and charge. The location is great as I can get a meal or do grocery shopping. More shopping centers should get chargers. Charging is also alot cheaper now it's no longer by the minute.

Left charger wouldn't connect at all. They charge per minute not kW and were never close to max charge speed (topped at 170kw when the car can pull 220+) which is always concerning.

Decent place to charge
This charging station would not work with my car. I called customer service and was told my car was shutting off the charge I drove 1/2 mile to the Nissan dealership and charged my car with no problem. Second time in 3 days EV Go could not charge my Kona.

"I’ve never had a problem with the charging station itself. However, it seems either customers or employees of the AAA shop don’t recognize that this is a charging station and not a parking spot. The little lot in front of the shop does get full. However, the big lot a few dozen yards away in front of and to the side of Target is never full. It is inconvenient to not be able to park right in front of the place you’re going. But in any situation where you wouldn’t park and leave you car in front of a gas pump for an hour or so, you shouldn’t do that in front of an EV charging station. EVgo sells the use of that space for charging. If you just park in it, you’re basically stealing."

Really cool EV station popped next to Lowes Foods. Nice and clean! brand new four spots. Great for cars that needs charging near Lowes.

Place to go with plenty of open spaces.

"Took multiple attempts to start the charging process but once it started it kept a pretty consistent 20ish mph on a 30amp. Cost of charging at the time of writing this review is $0.025 per minute. Charged a Tesla Model Y with J1772 adapter. The Evgo app stated that my charge point was available when I was still getting a charge, so the app is not that reliable. There are 2 J1772 spots at one box and a CCS and Chademo at the other box."

Seems like always available. I drive by this place often and don't see anyone charging. Possibly because people are still not ready for paid charging when free charging is available often

"There is a broken card reader at a stall and is ""app only"" until fixed. It's a little deceptive that the chargers are called Evolve NY when in reality Shell owns and manages them, but they try to shrink the Shell logo on the stalls to hide that fact. The (usually) optional app is also called Shell Recharge. It makes me feel bad to support a fossil fuel company. However, this is the fastest charger near me and EVGo, despite matching energy spent with 100% renewable energy, is much slower for my vehicle's charging capabilities."

"Gross negligence by tesla to not study traffic patterns. This little town, New Paltz I guess, has GROSSLY inadequate traffic flow coming off thruway. Took 6minutes off highway and that's with a somewhat awkward uturn.. Waiting in normal flow would be two to three times longer. This is Fri afternoon in summer but take it into account. Getting back on highway should be simpler."

Got 20% battery added in 7 minutes. Cost was free, as Ford gave us some minutes. My first time ever using a charger."

"3 week update! Went back, only two of four chargers worked. So, I had to wait whilst a charger came available. Charging went fine - Just wish they were all working. I will try others in the future; need better than 50% for me to rely on them for trips."

"Worked as advertised. Another gentleman was charging his EV at the same time. Both #1 and #2 worked well. Plugged in, selected #1 in my EA app - two minutes (!) later, charging away.

"We used this charger on the 13 and 16 of January 2023 and it was filthy on both occasions. The chargers are fast but the actual area is very unkept by, what I must assume, are other Tesla drivers. So much garbage on, around or in the path of the charging stations."

Once again today I charged for a full hour and got about 70 miles. It cost 10 bucks for the privilege. This has not been my experience at any other supercharger

"Update: September 2020: Only one of the charge ports work, Whole Foods has known about this for 6 months but has yet to fix or replace it despite customers prompts."

"Works fine though the charger is hard to release from time to time. Also you occasionally get someone who ignores the fact it's ev only and parks there, or someone with an ev who isn't charging will park there. So even if the app shows an open charger you might be out of luck. However that is not the fault of ChargePoint but selfish members of the public."

Two dedicated spots for EV 240v chargers. They are free to use and a wonderful asset to Baton Rouge. However I've already encountered people parking ICE vehicles illegally on weekends when there when there is a free garage on the opposite side of the street. Btw you will need to feed the parking meter during normal business hours.

"This supercharger is tucked behind a strip mall. I tried a couple stalls and I could never get more than 90kW on my model 3, which feels very slow after being accustomed to 140kW+. There are lots of good food options here which is nice. I also couldn't get an internet connection to my car so theater mode wasn't available. I'd recommend trying to skip this supercharger."

"If you’re driving between Minneapolis and Chicago and are hungry, make this your first stop, not Mauston. A little ways off freeway, but it’s a nice stop. Lots of grassy spots for the dog and Panera and Noodle Company for decently healthy food options. Speedy chargers, although a few gas-powered cars took up some spots."

If you've been to an EA charging station you know what you're getting. I've never had an issue here unlike some other stations in MN that always have stations out of service. Just wish there was more than one in the Twin Cities metro area. Also I suggest setting the app up on your phone before arriving to help prevent issues at the station.

Can get busy and fairly frequently some are not functional but still show on the app as available. Hard to park to wait if none available.

"Fantastic & a VERY CONVENIENT location!! As with most Tesla superchargers stations, they’re primarily located on interstates & typically near next truckstops and small hotels. For those traveling on “the 10/20,” this provides a good midpoint, particularly if you’re driving long distance. Of course, there are other MULTIPLE stations (plural) whether driving East or West: b/t Midland and Dallas, -OR- Midland and El Paso. While I have certainly no complaints about this “standard 8 charging ports” station, the only “con“ that is applicable is that while road improvements are certainly a good thing, the city of Midland is currently doing extensive road construction at this intersection & for a very, very long time. The last few times I’ve been here, this relatively important intersection has been continually down to ‘ONE LANE’ in ALL directions so allow for a little more time going “to & fro.” Additionally, it would be nice if TESLA had a station in Odessa on 20 as well but such has yet to be implemented. However, a Tesla technician tell me, roughly 4 & 1/2 yrs ago - that Midland actually had this Tesla supercharger station installed ”early in” - [even] B4 San Antonio ever had ONE (U can imagine the bureaucratic “red tape” involved in any EV installation) of these convenient stations due to many factors….so this speaks well of the city of Midlands willingness for innovation & growth!"

While I have certainly no complaints about this “standard 8 charging ports” station, the only “con“ that is applicable is that while road improvements are certainly a good thing, the city of Midland is currently doing extensive road construction at this intersection & for a very, very long time. The last few times I’ve been here, this relatively important intersection has been continually down to ‘ONE LANE’ in ALL directions so allow for a little more time going “to & fro.” Additionally, it would be nice if TESLA had a station in Odessa on 20 as well but such has yet to be implemented. However, a Tesla technician tell me, roughly 4 & 1/2 yrs ago - that Midland actually had this Tesla supercharger station installed ”early in” - [even] B4 San Antonio ever had ONE (U can imagine the bureaucratic “red tape” involved in any EV installation) of these convenient stations due to many factors….so this speaks well of the city of Midlands willingness for innovation & growth!"

"“If TESLA, today (2023), tried to support the ‘needs’ of all current transportation, it could handle about 1% or so of the nation’s transportation.”"
- From an interview sry late last year.

"This is, very much, still, a technology in its infancy, that, & like all forms of transportation, since the horse and buggy, will continue to evolve, though I must admit, I don’t mind skipping my gas bill of MANY yrs ago (ESP since last “ICE” vehicle in 2012 was an SUV that ang’d approx 9mpg!).! Anyway, like all technologies, things will evolve, and people still have a lot of questions in regards to the EV industry and I’m only happy to answer such questions after a decade of owning/driving exclusively, EV…half of that decade, owning/driving exclusively multiple Teslas."

"Also of NOTE: unfortunately, there are people who, dislike the EV industry, primarily out of fear and misinformation. It’s unfortunate as, in all of our lifetimes, ANYbody who is alive today, will ABSOLUTELY NOT be impacted by the EV industry as it pertains to their employment. Those with this mindset might be wise to think & naysayers should just relax, and understand that technology, no matter what industry it’s applicable to, will continue to evolve like ALL technology has since the dawn of time. I could say much more in regards to this but as this is not the place for such discourse, those that do you have legitimate interests, again, feel free to contact me, and I am more than happy to enlighten anybody about the pros and cons of the fantastic “EV World” and help you to understand the differences as they definitely DO exist. Good day & blessings to all! Take good care! ✌"
"Fantastic & a VERY CONVENIENT location!! As with most Tesla superchargers stations, they’re primarily located on interstates & typically near next truckstops and small hotels. For those traveling on “the 10/20,” this provides a good midpoint, particularly if you’re driving long distance. Of course, there are other MULTIPLE stations (plural) whether driving East or West: b/t Midland and Dallas, -OR- Midland and El Paso. While I have certainly no complaints about this “standard 8 charging ports” station, the only “con“ that is applicable is that while road improvements are certainly a good thing, the city of Midland is currently doing extensive road construction at this intersection & for a very, very long time. The last few times I’ve been here, this relatively important intersection has been continually down to ‘ONE LANE’ in ALL directions so allow for a little more time going “to & fro.” Additionally, it would be nice if TESLA had a station in Odessa on 20 as well but such has yet to be implemented. However, a Tesla technician tell me, roughly 4 & 1/2 yrs ago - that Midland actually had this Tesla supercharger station installed ”early in” - [even] B4 San Antonio ever had ONE (U can imagine the bureaucratic “red tape” involved in any EV installation) of these convenient stations due to many factors….so this speaks well of the city of Midlands willingness for innovation & growth!"

Little Info:
"“Very Versed” in EVs (I’ve been the owner of 4 EVs since 2013 - 2023; a decade). IF U have ANY questions in regards such (driving an EV is different in regards to an ICE vehicle, please feel free to ASK.

4 fast chargers. Customer service had to reset to get a good rate of charge.
None of the chargers are working. None.

"We just finished a 2,400 mile road trip from Plano, TX to Phoenix, AZ and back. Super charging was easy and convenient to the highways. I-40 from Dallas to Phoenix and I-10 to I-20 to I-30 on the way home. While some sites included amenities, many sites did not include amenities, such as restrooms. The worst was behind an out of business Sonic drive-in."
"But the great news was that all chargers were working, and we never had to share a charger on a V2. The costs at the charging were higher than expected. The available info on the website was that the national average was $0.28 per kWh. Texas was $0.42 per kWh. New Mexico was $0.32 per kWh. Arizona was time-based, ranging from $0.11 to $0.42 per kWh. At highway speeds, we averaged three miles per kWh."

"Strange charging experience here. It's in the back lot of a Tesla showroom. We were coming from Santa Rosa NM, ~200 miles away. We were a little range anxious, as there was not much in between. Lubbock showed 0 chargers of 4 total available. We figured we could wait in line, if needed."

"Well, down the road from Santa Rosa, the car rerouted, wanting to take us back to the charger that we just came from. We rebooted and it sent us on our way, so we pressed on."

"When we arrived, all 4 chargers were available, but the info still showed zero. We were charging at 250kW until we reach about 75% when it dropped to 25-30kW. Luckily it was enough to get us where we needed."

"If the showroom isn't open, there are no bathroom facilities on premises. You can walk to some fast food places from here, but the paths are not the best."

"When we arrived, all 4 chargers were available, but the info still showed zero. We were charging at 250kW until we reach about 75% when it dropped to 25-30kW. Luckily it was enough to get us where we needed."

"If the showroom isn't open, there are no bathroom facilities on premises. You can walk to some fast food places from here, but the paths are not the best."
"Very busy, need few more super chargers. Only has 4 chargers. 5 minutes walk and cross the road there are some restaurants."

No bathroom available on the weekend. Walked to a Taco Bell for my wife to use one. Not my idea of how a customer buying a luxury vehicle should be treated. Shameful.

"It’s definitely hidden but not difficult to find. As mentioned in a previous post, restrooms are inside the main lobby, second door on the right as you walk towards the entrance of the hotel. The lady at the front desk is very helpful and polite. Snacks are available to purchase at a reasonable price. Hotel seems very clean and judging by the condition the restrooms were in I wouldn’t doubt staying here. A++"

"Got here on a Monday morning and was the only Tesla until the white M3 joined me. Charging was consistent and as advertised. Finding the chargers was not hard. Going West as soon as you exit, hit an immediate right turn and then another right turn into the hotel parking lot. The young guy in the front office was nice. Bought water, talked a bit, and allowed me to use the bathroom. I wasn't hungry so I can't comment on the food situation however there are snacks for sale in the lobby. This charging station has the basics. Nothing fancy. Pretty much an in and out kinda vibe."

"Stayed at the Quality Inn on 3/25/23 on our way back to L.A.. Super convenient to have the Tesla Superchargers across from our room. The Tesla map says the superchargers are offline, but called the manager to confirm they are in fact working. We actually skipped this location and used the Electrify America charger on our way to Austin because we saw that it was offline. So glad we got a chance to stay at the hotel and use the supercharger. Please be nice to the manager and mindful of your trash. The manager is super nice and he's had some encounters with really rude Tesla owners. Let's all be better and courteous to the hotel locations. They try and accommodate travelers with their restroom facilities and try to provide vending services with food and drinks. Also note that if you travel during the late night early morning hours they do close their lobby for safety purposes. Great stay and awesome convenient charging location."

"We made 2 stops here during the Thanksgiving break. When heading West the right is a bit snaky and comes up quick. After making the second right into the hotel parking lot you'll find 6 stalls on your right. The first trip required no wait and charging was fast. On the way back, there was a 30 minute wait before getting started and we ended up spending just over an hour here."

"The owner was friendly and spent some time explaining the politics of charging while we waited. We bought a few snacks and were allowed to use the restrooms. Very basic stop, but required for most traveling I-10."

You gotta go to Skeet's Country Grill while you wait! It's a 2 minute walk. So freakin' good!!! I Don't understand why people complain about walking to the front door of the hotel. It's only a 30 second walk to get there.

OK but had to walk all the way around the hotel to get inside to use the bathroom. No food close by. Otherwise fine

"The charger is located around the back of the building at the furthest point from the front door. Check in up front, get your key, then drive around to charge or you can’t get in the back door as it is locked but opens with electronic hotel key."

The charger is an 8Kwh charger or about 24 miles per hour. It is good if your staying over night. It charges about the same as a 50 amp RV park 15-40 connection. It is not the 16KW I was expecting. I believe the charger has the capacity but the electrician only installed a 50 amp breaker instead of a 100 amp and turned it down.

"There are two chargers in the corner of a parking lot at the VERY back. Installation was poorly though out. Instead of one charger for each parking spot they are mounted in the corner of one spot furthest from spot 2, making it difficult to reach the second car."

Neither of the spots are designated electric vehicle. Making it “not obvious for a ICE vehicle” that it is one of only two electric vehicle charging spots.

"When I arrived one spot, the one without the chargers in front of it, was taken up by an Internal combustion engine (ICE) thereby rendering one spot completely inaccessible."
The hotel appears to be nice.

The charger is an 8Kwh charger or about 24 miles per hour. It is good if your staying over night. It charges about the same as a 50 amp RV park 15-40 connection. It is not the 16KW I was expecting. I believe the charger has the capacity but the electrician only installed a 50 amp breaker instead of a 100 amp and turned it down.

"There are two chargers in the corner of a parking lot at the VERY back. Installation was poorly though out. Instead of one charger for each parking spot they are mounted in the corner of one spot furthest from spot 2, making it difficult to reach the second car."

Neither of the spots are designated electric vehicle. Making it “not obvious for a ICE vehicle” that it is one of only two electric vehicle charging spots.

"When I arrived one spot, the one without the chargers in front of it, was taken up by an Internal combustion engine (ICE) thereby rendering one spot completely inaccessible."

"Great charging experience. I activate the charger via the app, then plug in the nozzle. I use this site often when I visit South Bend, and there is a convenient mall nearby. I get up to 53kwh for the Bolt EUV."

Worked perfectly. First time. No problems or issues. Within walking distance to the University Park Mall. Nice set up... Convenient... And not crowded. I highly recommend this charging station!

One pump was rather slow so we needed to use a different one. Too bad when the mall is closed there are not nearby facilities like restrooms or food.

Not that fast. Got here with 15% and only 193mi/hr and excellent spot with the mall. If you come after hours that's a different story though.

"If hungry or needing a restroom, be aware that the amenities aren't that great at the site itself. Yes there is Sam's Club, but it's not 24-7, and there is no fast food within quick walking distance. Nonetheless it is not far off the interstate, and has two 350 kWs if your EV is capable, in addition to the 150 kWs. Suggest stopping for takeout on the way down Westnedge, as there are plenty of options, and then eating while you charge. Or you could call ahead for Texas Roadhouse takeout as it's very close to the chargers. The parking is angled and poles block pulling through several stalls. Thus if you have a charge port in the rear you will likely need to do a three point turn for the cords to reach on the 350 kW chargers."

"Charger worked great. Just had to reverse to the very back of the space because the charge cord wasn’t quite long enough to reach my front, driver side charge port"

Was able to grab some pizza at Sam’s Club and use the restroom. They don’t require a membership to buy food at their cafe

Two out of six charging stations would not work. This has been an ongoing issue at this location before many months. Avoid this slice at all costs until anywhere else unless you want to deal with non-functioning card readers or non-operational charging cables.

"I've used these stations twice - once to test charging my new 22 Bolt EUV, then another time when we were out of power for 4 days after a huge ice storm. I was grateful these chargers were available and it really got us out of a pinch because we were then able to keep our refrigerators, and furnace running using our EV for a couple extra days before the power came back on!"

Note that we were there on a Thu at 8:30pm and all of the restaurants in the convenience store were closed, you could still get snacks from the gas station but the actual restaurants were closed."

"Standard “next to Meijer” charging station. Within walking distance of 3 minutes from Biggby Coffee shop that has variety of hot and cold beverages, bagel sandwiches (customizable ingredients, served toasted or cold), and some treats."

The First and only Tesla Supercharger in the Portage/Kalamazoo area. It's a big addition to the city for the Tesla Owners. The location could have been much better. It's tucked towards the right side of the Meijer building. With all the construction going on due to the remodeling of the Meijer it could get a little busy near there. Unfortunately the area is not well maintained with grass growing all over the place and trash being left around the chargers.

"Fast charger, easy access from the highway."
"The best thing about this location is that it’s near Pacific Rim/Cravings, where they have awesome noodles/ramen/Asian food and boba."
Only thing is I wish all these supercharger stations would have trash bins so people don’t leave rubbish everywhere.

Caution: Many screws and nails found directly in front of charging stalls!

"*Back after 8 months, looks like they cleaned the area up. No longer see screws and pallets everywhere."

250 kw charging is the only thing positive about this charger.

"Chargers are tucked way, WAY, out of the way on the side of Meijer. Walking to the store to get snacks or use a restroom will require a substantial walk. Disable people don't have access to any facilities."

"After reading the reviews, I was hesitant on coming here because I had barely enough charge to make it to Rochester. I decided to chance it and come by, and thankfully I was able to snag one of the fast chargers. Fast chargers are pretty much non-existent in Rochester so I have nothing to compare it against. However, 30 minutes got me about 30% in charge."

I’ve charged my 2022 Ioniq 5 five or six times here in the last month. No issues whatsoever. The 350kW chargers have worked perfectly every time. Plug in and go. Not sure what has been happening for the people who have left negative reviews but my experience here has been positive every time.

"UPDATE: tried going here on 11/8/22 and 11/15/22. The station was out of service both times. It appears it is being repaired or upgraded. Regardless, as of 11/15/22, the station is NOT operational."

UPDATE 2: visited on 11/26/22 and the station is back online. 3 of the 4 charging stations have been upgraded to newer models. Charging station 4 is still one of the older models but it still works fine as it is the one I used.

UPDATE 3: visited on 12/19/22. All 3 of the newly installed charging stations were “unavailable”. The older station still there was operational and in use.

It appears this location has become unreliable since they chose to upgrade the charging stations. Very disappointing.

Recently upgraded to latest generation chargers. Hopefully reliability will improve as a result and our first charge here post-renovation was flawless.

"I live in the city of Buffalo and these chargers are down/unavailable more than they are available. Oftentimes, there's only one charger available for use making it especially difficult for people who visit this area and have no other alternatives. These chargers malfunction during colder months, y'all gotta work that out because the temps in Buffalo can get frigid. The availability of chargers should also be transparent via internet search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) and not only using your app. I've spoken to many nice out-of-town folks (some who don't speak fluent English -add more language selections on the stations) who go into panic mode when they can't charge their vehicle because chargers are limited. I always offer up mine because I am closer to home and never want to experience what that feels like. The demand for EV's doesn't align with the supply of charging stations and/or the amount of kWh sometimes promised per charge. There's too much stress and pressure on consumers and not enough action taken by Companies who should be making the transition from gas to an EV easier. The goal for creating a cleaner Earth is a bit one-sided. You have to supply better chargers if you really want to ""Electrify America""."

"NOTE: THIS 134 High St/850 Michigan Ave parking garage is now a PRIVATE garage only for pass-holders of the Buffalo-General Medical Center and the Wyndham Garden Downtown Hotel (125 High St). So the 10 FREE ChargePoint level-2 chargers are in regular use for commuters, although as a hotel guest I got to use the charger to re-charge my Kona overnight (for the hotel valet parking charge of $18) because I arrived after 7pm, and all but one of the chargers were available. The hotel's evening valet went with me let me into the garage to set up the charging session, and the morning valet went with me to let me drive out. That morning when I checked out, the other 9 chargers were being used, and I was probably depriving some 8am arriving commuter of #6's use."

"The only CHAdeMO has been broken since July.. we call weekly and there is no ETA for them fixing it. We have service members who spent $500 to buy an adapter to use Electrify, which has been a waste of money apparently.. and now have to drive 1 hour away to charge their cars, and then back 1 hour because Electrify is not fixing it. So they definitely don't take care of their equipment. I would definitely not give this company a penny - it's ridiculous."

36 miles/hr which was awesome when the destination charger in Navarre was out of order. You do not have to be a guest at Portofino to use this; one is outside of their gates.

"I had to have a deposit of $50 everytime I charged up. I deposited $$ into my electrify account but instead of charging my electrify account it kept charging my bank card on file. Very upset. Because of my traveling experience out of town, I will not ever use this car to travel again. I also do not want the headache and expenses of using electrify ever again. Ripped me off"

Awesome location to get your Tesla charged.. depending how long you plan to stay. It's free! Helps with bumping up driving range if dealing with RANGE ANXIETY till get to a Tesla Super Charger. Which is what I NEEDED. 2 charging ports 1) 29A at about a rate of 24 MPH. And the other is 32A at about 30 MPH.

Both chargers have equipment failure… so no way to charge at all here

"Great Supercharger. Level 3 - 250KW. Next to Starbucks and in the parking lot of a Panera. We've used it several times, whether as the last charge before Destin or the first when leaving Destin. Never been more than a few cars charging at a time. Very close to I-10."

"Very fast at around 500 miles of range an hour. The Starbucks next door is very busy, usually slower to get your drinks. As you'll be here around 30 minutes anyways, I wasn't in a rush to get my green tea very quickly. Weird Starbucks interior, but it works. Nice outdoor sitting area. There's other places nearby, but I like to be able to watch the supercharger area as there's a busy ATM right next to it and homeless people looking for handouts in the middle of the day."

"Did not show up as a super charger on the Tesla Google Map but absolutely working and lots of shopping nearby. 100 feet away from Starbucks and Panera bread but pretty much everything from lodging to eatery close by. Didn’t have to wait until Mobile, AL on I-10 after Defuniak Springs."

"If you've never been to buc-ee's then you're in for an experience with the busiest service station I've ever been in. This time was my first time going and have never been in such a huge gas station, Tesla supercharge spot, and souvenir shop all-in-one. The restroom lines were a little long but the restroom attendants kept everything moving swiftly so the lines went down pretty quickly. Also the cashiers are swift and plentiful to make it easier getting checked out with ease. It is definitely a tourist spot and a place where you can grab a quick bite while on the road. They have different types of sandwiches, salads, tacos, burritos, and sweet treats made up and ready to grab."

"I must confess to being a major fan of Buc'ees. That did, this is the best Supercharger anywhere, in my opinion. Buc'ees is a logical pick. Their restroom facilities are the cleanest in the industry & never closed or out of order. They always have an ample selection of food & drinks. If you need to buy a gift for someone on the way, they are the logical choice. I hope Tesla adds Superchargers at EVERY Buc'ees in the near future."

"Decent supercharge. Often a lot of trash in the area from less than conscientious users. 150KW max. Been there several times where we were the only car. Been there times where it was completely full and everyone was power-sharing. Quite a ways off the Interstate with a lot of poorly timed stopped lights between. Several miles North of I-10. We try to skip this one, charging at the Level 3 charger in D'Iberville instead."

"I’ve been using Electrify America since October. Have been to 5 different location’s multiple times. They have all been very reliable, parking spots are all oversized. Once you have gone to a 150KW charger you will not want to go anywhere else. I hope to see new locations in the north east area. I95, I80, I78."

Plenty of chargers and a convenient location. The only drawback is that there is nothing nearby if you want to get snacks or find a restroom while charging.

"Meh. Took a a few minutes to install the EV Connect app and get it connected to the charger. After that, it finally connected and started charging. Rate of charge was much lower than I expected. You're better off going to the Whole Foods and using those free chargers. Rate was only 29 A - 206V. Connected for 10 mins and the charger stopped and started charging 3 times. It sent me a text message every time too. Reston will be getting a Tesla Supercharger soon (listed as coming soon). I doubt I'll ever come back to this charger."

On a more candid note I was blown away when I visited Connecticut Post Mall and decided to go take a look this Tesla Supercharger station. This is not what we see in Africa all the time. It was amazing just looking at the rolls of the superchargers.

Lots of chargers next to Macy’s at a mall. We were the only ones there at 10 AM on a Saturday and went from 15 to 100% in about 45 minutes. The mall opens at 10am so it was easy to kill time there. Note there are not breakfast options in the food court although it’s open. After we left we learned there was a Starbucks somewhere in the mall- but we didn’t see it when we were in there.

"Of note- there is a family lounge in the food court with comfortable chairs, couches, and children play area and toys - great for breastfeeding as someone who has done so in an open area food court at chargers prior."

4 stars because because I’d rather have a charger at a normal rest stop where everything is close together and malls are just a sad vibe

Note there are not breakfast options in the food court although it’s open. After we left we learned there was a Starbucks somewhere in the mall- but we didn’t see it when we were in there.

"Of note- there is a family lounge in the food court with comfortable chairs, couches, and children play area and toys - great for breastfeeding as someone who has done so in an open area food court at chargers prior."

Got a complementary charge session here on our drive from Boston to Delaware. Great also to have a McDonalds 30 feet away with quick service and a clean bathroom.

Thankful of the speeds at this location. The parking lot can get a bit chaotic with the drive through for McDonald’s queuing in front of the spaces around lunch time + limited parking for Marshall’s on the weekends.

A lot were out of order but we were able to charge. If you're needing a stop on a longer drive to charge/eat etc. Villa Pizzeria restaurant was a nice place to grab a meal while waiting

"This station works great with only one major issue. The spot is almost always ICE'd. The Trader Joes is very popular (especially on weekends) and gas cars block the two spots that can use this station constantly. They have added a sign since the Google Street view photo was taken (which, ironically shows two gas cars blocking the spots at the time of this posting), but people ignore the sign. When I've politely pointed this out, people either respond with a nasty reply or ignore me. Perhaps if the state makes this illegal and starts towing, people will learn to be a bit more considerate."

"Two fast superchargers in relatively good repair. This service plaza has big surges of activity, and when it does these two Tesla supercharger spaces are frequently taken or obstructed by conventional/internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, aka ICE'd. This is a big inconvenience given that it takes 30 to 40 minutes to get a decent charge, despite the very fast charger. I hope the plaza management can come up with an enforcement policy to protect these spaces for Teslas, especially once all those Model 3's hit the road!"

Fine charger. I’ve stopped here twice. No issues. There’s only two bays. If both are used then charging rate drops. Worse case hop over to the northbound side rest stop and there’s more there

Right next to the interstate in Milford Plaza but just got to 88kW max. Make sure to park close as cable is short.

"The map is not correct. This is in the Panera parking lot on the SOUTH side of Route 7. I spent several minutes driving around in circles over on the NORTH side of Route 7 looking for it because it was shown on the wrong location on the map. This has 4 EV charging stations with Level 3 FAST DC chargers. It cost me 30 cents per minute, but it's FAST. In 11 minutes I got 7 kWh (about 28 miles for me at 4 miles / kWh) and it cost me $3.30."

"This charging station is not bad, you can charge your car at a very fast speed around 150 kW."
"I gave 3 stars, because very often, during the mall opening hours, I found most of charging spaces occupied by non-electric vehicles, some of the gas-car drivers even just put the charger hose around their cars hood and left it like this for hours. Since nobody really cares if parked car is electric or not, that works really good for that cheaters and not good for electric car which needs a charge."

"This charging station is not bad, you can charge your car at a very fast speed around 150 kW."

"This is the kind of place you hope to find when you pull in to feed your Tesla. The Falls Church Supercharger has fast 250kw stalls and active strip mall with lots of things to grab your attention. Looking for something to eat yourself? There's the delicious Tara Thai, Starbucks, Jason's deli , Bing&Bao (a chinese Bao restaurant!), Noodles & Company and Whole Foods. Seriously, by the time you're done picking out road snacks at Whole Foods your Tesla is ready to tear up some more road. Also, as a bonus, there's plenty of room here to pull into the charger spots!"

"Super Charger that goes up to 250 kw, at the back of shopping center with Wholefoods. There’s 8 stations and each one is connected to 4 units (1A-1D, 2A-2D). The one near our house is only up to 150 kw, so extra 100 kw is nice. There’s several food options here so that you can eat while you charge up."

"Got here very early on a cold December morning. I was expecting at least a 250 mi/hr charging, but very disappointed to see much lower charging speeds. There was only one other charger occupied at this time."

Great location for getting something to eat or drink though while you wait for the charging to complete.

Always packed but people were courteous and quick to charge both times I visited. I was four cars deep waiting the first time and I waited 20 minutes. The second time I was the second car waiting and was charging within 10 minutes. There's a Starbucks in the same plaza just around the corner (~1min walk).

"There are two J1772 charging stations at this location, one at each end of Giant Food. The app does not state the power capacities of the chargers. I've used the charger on the east side of Giant (closer to CVS), and it charged my Volvo Recharge at about 7 miles per hour, which is pretty slow for that vehicle -- suggesting that these chargers are at the lower-power end of the J1772 range."

"Great stop on our trip from Cincinnati to Asheville. Super fast charging and with so many stalls we had our own stall. Lots of food and coffee options including Chick-fil-A and Chuy's. Also, it's in the the Meijer parking lot which is convenient for snacks etc. Meijer is stepping up their game with chargers but there's also a Target if that's more your speed."

I'm making this in hope someone can help them they have said no one is taking them seriously to help get it fixed. So far if you see this set your tesla charge amps to 30 at the max"

Overall the service was average. One issue is that there are limited charging stations along various semi large cities. The other issue is that not all charging stations were operable. Had issues in charger stopping during the initialization stage of the charge with the vehicle. Had to contact customer services to try to resolve problems. Many times was told to switch charging station. Not sure if the problem is with the agreement between Lucid and Electrify America.
The last issue is the rate of charge. This was mostly low in the 50 to 70kW range while others were getting higher rates when charging at the same % at the same time. Again not sure if it is a problem with Lucid or EA.

As good as any other Wal-Mart charging¹ station. The area has some semi containers blocking the view so be careful. There was three old guys having a few drinks close to the chargers. They kept to themselves so it was okay. The charger worked great.

"Used this station in the AM and then tried to stop again on my way back. All 6 pedestals out of order. Called FPL and they recommended I go somewhere else. When I informed them I couldn’t, they opened a generic support issue including asking me when would be the best time to call me back. Then they said since it’s a weekend, response time might be over an hour. They had no ability to reboot the pedestals remotely. Station was very fast in the morning."

EDIT: An upper level EV support person followed up and explained that an emergency shut off switch was tripped for this charging location and they had to dispatch a truck to get it back online. They also explained they are working on providing dedicated EV support on nights and weekends. They already have support agents during the week who are better equipped to support the EV chargers. We had a nice discussion and overall I get the impression that FPL is serious about making a strong contribution to Florida’s EV charging infrastructure. I look forward to the future!

"Very good charging station with convenient restrooms, food, drinks, and outside walking area with pond…I find the Buc’ee charging stations very good, just takes a lot of driving through parking areas and dodging pickup trucks. At this store, the charging is in the furthest back corner on North end. Stay on entrance road past the store and take last left into parking and straight back. Apparently there are alligators in the pond."

I visited here last trip and love this Tesla charger. The Private parking area is behind Wawa and next to Chick-fil-a. Zaxby’s is across street if you want to grab something there. There is another charger set on other side of I-95 in old outlet mall so navigate carefully if you are trying to get here.

"Mediocre location. We had to drive completely around a outlet strip mall to get to the charging location. Six chargers, and two of them are roped off with construction tape, ostensibly because they don’t work (and probably no plans to fix them soon because this site clearly isn’t frequented too often)."

We charge here frequently. The location is right in the center of the shopping plaza under some trees. It makes for an easy walk to the restrooms and the food court. Several of the shops give a discount if you show your fob. We have only ever experienced one negative and that was when the parking lot was bring redone about a year ago. They had the entrance closed and we had to drive around the back of the shops and enter thru an exit. Not a big deal once you know how to do this.

Follow the pathway around the lake on the left as you face it and you’ll find a kids play area and public restrooms. We arrived during the local farmers market. Nice charger to take a break with young kids!

It's in a bay door. So be prepared to move it semi comes to drop off load.

Love the Tesla Supercharger. 150 miles in 30 minutes of charge for $15
Roughly a half mile from I-40. Within walking distance of an Arby’s & a Chick-Fil-A. Lowes Foods and a few local shops & eateries to choose from as well. Has lighting for those that need to charge at night.

"This is one of the most inconvenient electric charging brand ever!!!!! The only station close to Stafford, Missouri city, and sugarland! There are 3 charging stations here and are 150 kW & only one of them was working and the speed was 21 kW!!! Of the three the only working is soooo slow. This is the second time I’m coming here and there’s problems. Save yourself the time! Additionally, the app doesn’t even reflect the fact that barely any of them work & are severely slowed down. I’ve called about this about 2-3 times and they don’t really care about their customers!!"

Don’t even waste your time. These chargers never work and when they do it’s slow as ever and they charge an arm and leg. Barely can get 7-10kwh and they’ll charge you full price. I called customer service and they were 0 help. Avoid at all costs . I’ve been tons of times and never work

We installed the 50Amp charge port at home so seldom come here to charge. We only charged the loaner Model X twice or three times here. This location is very close to our subdivision. I just hope there are more supercharger around Houston area.

Got a Tesla from Avis. I am in love. These stations make it so easy. Charged in 40 min or less. Some stations have a charge limit but that's ok.

"The app let's you know when these are available, unlike charging stations that are free, you have to physically go there to see if there's one available. It can be very inconvenient. Other than that, they're very easy to use."

The DC charger is about half as fast as most chargers in the Evgo network. Normally my Nissan Leaf takes about 20 minutes to go from 10% to 80%. This charger took over 40 minutes.

On the plus side the proximity to the cracker barrel means clean restrooms are close and you can sit on a rocker on the front porch while you wait. Or you can grab a meal if it is not too busy.

There was a security guard but he didn't say anything when we went to charge and just didn't pay.

The fast charger was working. We used it to bring my Nissan leaf from 18% up to 81%. One word of caution. OSU has disabled the stop button on the charger and the one in the app also does not work. You have to use your cell phone or Chargepoint card to reauthorize in order to stop the charger. This caused some frantic moments before I discovered this. The fast charger will not unlock the charge cable from the car without a stop command. I would advise OSU to add some signage explaining this to people using their charger.

New set of chargers in Frederick in the new Sheetz station. Not the easiest charger to get to especially if you are towing a trailer. We were able to use the pull-in charger so we did not have to unhook the trailer.

Potential pump traffic could case problems backing in. There is a potential to charge with a trailer attached if the parking spots next to the chargers are not in use.

"There are 4 charging spots and it can get busy, specially during peak hours. I've sometimes had issues with one of the chargers being unresponsive or not working. But it's a convenient location. Until it's after 9pm. Electrify America says this is a 24 hr location but access is cut off once the outlet mall is closed."

"Google maps, as of 12/16/2022 has the charging stations incorrectly located at the mall. it's basically under the I-270 south bound ramp. there is a central reservation opening that has been blocked off, and the mapping makes it look like you have to go into the parking lot. do not do this, the parking lot is a zoo. just go all the way around the mall drive and come up on the chargers the long way around. also, not sure why all the new developments in MD up to Frederick are being designed with roundabouts basically no one knows how to use them, people are either impatient or very confused, no one knows how to sign and the mall itself, a zoo in the parking lot. long story short if you're not a native of the area, best to avoid the station unless you really need it. I've submitted a change request from Google maps, not sure if it will get fixed - just take the long way around. oh and the first charger I went to had a cord with a communication error."

Beware that Google maps has the location slightly wrong. You need to enter the Premium Outlets and the chargers are located on the outer parking lot close to the Michael Kors store. If you follow Google maps you'll find yourself entering I-270 with no way back!

"Electrify America was great when I first got my EV in February. Since then there seems to have been a steady decline. Half the stations are broken and it can take over 30 min to get support on the line only to find out that the station you are trying to use, and looks like it is in service doesn't actually work - but they won't take it off line to prevent people from wasting their time. EA used to be way better than other charging networks. Now they are just average."

"Two out of the three times I've been to this station I've had to call Electrify America to have them push a charge to my car because the payment function wasn't working with a credit card or through the app. Otherwise it's nice to get quick shopping done at Walmart while the car is charging. The Walmart is a decent Walmart. The chargers at this location are on the side when you park, not in the front."

"In a Walmart parking lot with a strip mall across the road, very convenient. The chargers will be next to your car instead of in front, and the cords aren't very long. If your charging port is on the front or back of your car, be prepared to park funny so it'll reach."

Very clean well lighted area. Clean restrooms. A few charges were however not staying on line at the time of use. But Electrify America was aware and they helpful with getting the other charger I was using online.

Drove out of my way to take advantage of their 350 kW charger. Only delivered 62kW. Previous visit at this station 1/2 the chargers were down even though they said they were working.

All four stalls still have a good bit of snow so don’t get stuck! All stalls were empty when I pulled in (and still are) so I chose stall (number four left to right) because it had the least amount of snow and I didn’t want to get stuck with my not great in snow Chevy Bolt. ..

The station here is up to 150 KW but I only started out at 17 KW and my car was at 27% state of charge. I’m now up to 28 KW and 42% state of charge. I’m assume this is a Bolt limitation and not an issue with the Electrify America station I plugged into. I would switch and try another station but because it’s a Bolt with very limited fast charging it’s not really worth it since I have time today. Our power at home has been off for 3 days now so I’m just glad to be able to charge the car.

"Location wise this charging station is located in the outer mall parking lot in front of the Dick’s Sporting Goods store, next to the new Logan’s Roadhouse restaurant. There are a couple of fast food restaurants somewhat close by if you wanted to get something before charging. I don’t consider them really within walking distance but for some they might be. The mall does have a food court…"

"For the love cheesecake and Bridgerton, please change location of this station to next the Logan’s roadhouse! 2 of the 4 charging stations were working, but I am sure the other two stations can be reset, and they’ll work just fine. Fyi the Tesla charger is one of the broken stations."

"Easy to find, however if you want a bite to eat, say at Panera, you’re forced to cross a large highway without a pedestrian crosswalk. It’s doable though, just cross at the point of the light cycle that you normally would. Be safe!"

"I was so excited to finally see Tesla’s V3 supercharging in Stafford, VA. It's very clean and right at the Wawa so you can take a break while you recharge plus it's 8 stalls. It's also right off I95 and keep it up Tesla. Glad to know that I now have more options for DC fast charging."

Great experience as usual. Wawa was good although I prefer Sheetz since they have more self checkouts and Wawa never had enough people working the registers.

"I charge my EQS twice a week for 30 min and it's been perfect every time except on 9/24 when the system stopped charging after a few minutes. Had enough charge to last so left and went back the next day and it was perfect. I'll start charging my Lucid there next week. I've seen Kia, F150, and Rivian owners charging without issue. Now, if they had more chargers available across the main travel routes, EVs would be able to go mainstream instead of restricted to tech types and early adopters like me."

Hard to find and need to back up into traffic through the shopping center to get to the chargers. Speed is as advertised though

It was great.
"As of May 2022, the overview section needs updating. See pics. This location has 2 charging stalls with 1-Chademo, 1-CCS1 combo and 1-Tesla connectors. There is no dedicated J1772 connector for charging. It's only 50KW, but if you have no other faster options, you can shop and eat while you juice up. I'm very glad DC fast charging infrastructure is growing and we need all hands on deck to move to vehicle electrification."

"Tried charging here 9 Aug 2022. We have an account, but could not get this station to charge our vehicle. Was EVgo having a problem or was it this station? - I can't say, but we found a different station 7 minutes away that charged us up without drama."
Gave 2 stars just for existing.

"I recently purchased the Ford Mustang Mach-E electric car. I went to Stone bridge to get a charge. In order that you use the Evgo Fast Charge, it require a subscription, the number is on the charging station. I called customer service, established an account, they walked me through the process. Be mindful, they only charge to 80% of the battery capacity, safety measure. In an hour, my charge was at 80% and I was off to enjoy a gas less ride."

Stopped by and all 4 charging spots were occupied by non-EVs. They unwisely selected the very best parking spots for access to the grocery store. Would you really expect people to avoid temptation to park there for convenience? Placement of these charges ignores real world considerations. And of course no enforcement - who wants to get parking lot-raged over that thankless job?

Station 4 is the only charger that consistently works. I always get errors on every other stations. I always have to go to other locations and only use the villa location in emergency. But I always have to use multiple times to get a full charge due to error.

These one are always open and there is never an unchanging Ev or non-Ev parked in the spaces. All others EVGo charging stations I been have people not even using them or non-EVs blocking the chargers

"Have charged here before, but today Ko e ChadeMo charger did not work. My experience with EVgo Chademo chargers in both NC and GA over the past year 07/2021 to 07/2022 is that they only work about 50% of the time. I'm glad I got to use some of the credit that came with my Nissan Leaf purchase, but the fact that it expires is really disappointing. All that to say: I will never plan to charge at another EVgo station ever again. Only if its my only option I will cross my fingers and hope that their unreliable chargers will work at even a 19kwh rate, much less the expectedit, full advertised 50kwh."

"This parking garage Supercharger station reminds me of a scene from a distopian movie. It's huge with about 21 chargers. If you need to stretch your legs, there's a Publix and shops above and within walking distance. As you enter the parking garage don't dismay, the first two hours are free. You should be charged and ready within that window of time."

"Okay so this place was very difficult to find, the charging station is under a parking garage, not under Target its the garage under Atlantic station."

Its on 20th street you make a left then enter and collect a ticket to pay for parking. Don’t worry parking is free for 2 hours and you only need 40 mins to charge.

"When you get into the garage and get the ticket make the very first right and drive down.You will see 30 stations and the day i came in, it was kinda full buh yeah definitely took me a while to find especially cus i came from Louisiana."

"If you're traveling through Atlanta you might want to pass this one. Located in a covered parking garage. Took a while to get to from I85. Though there's 30 stations there is no signage directing you to them. You enter through a gate, take a ticket and wander. Low ceiling and circled around before finding them. No garage parking fee under 2 hours, thankfully."

"First time utilizing this SC location and it was great - very chill and easy to get in and out. And I love that if you're just there to charge, you don't have to pay the parking garage rate so long as you're out before 2 hrs (new supercharger in Decatur is not as generous). I was charged up in 35 min and I will never not be happy seeing how little you pay vs. gas."

"Tesla navigation is accurate, led me right to P2 level. After you take your ticket, make the first right at the stop and you'll see a small red Tesla sign on a pillar to your left. Keep going straight and you can't miss all the stalls. Happy charging~"

Fantastic area for a charging station. Enter through the P2 entrance and it's to the immediate right. I agree there should be signage when u pull in and throughout the garage it would really help.
"Other than that it's a short walk to tons of shopping, bars and restaurants. Beware the idle fees though, this is a busy station and they don't mess around. Leave your car on the charger and it will cost you. Plus side is parking is free under 2 hours."

We popped by on the way home from Galveston and went to get a coffee and came back to a nice 79%charge. Quick and easy as it should be.
The charges are basically in the corner of the Walmart parking lot.

"I'm not sure how Electrify America is gonna survive with such attitude, - but I reparked my vehicle yesterday 4 F times. two 350's were out of service. 3rd one 350 didn't want to start charging sessions for unknown reason. last time finally 150 worked for me, - but I've got an error ""charging issue please reconnect or try another one"". Not even talking on where to look for stickers on the chargers with the numbers? Seriously?"

Pretty easy to use. Used my app and I was sent emails to give me start and end times. The charge spot is in a bright lit spot.

This is my favorite supercharger spot that I've been too. Can't beat a Bucees... The charging was fast and not many stalls in use.

"The only mild complaint I could mention is that it's a longish walk back and forth from the store without much in the way of pedestrian markings, walkways or anything. Just keep looking around and stay safe while you get a lovely kolache and brisket sammie!"

"Nothing beats ChargePoint service. Professional, convenient, and reliable. The only problem encountered is when the owner does not honor their contract with ChargePoint and starts to operate the charger preferentially allowing certain vehicles to charge while preventing/towing others. These unfair practices are not under ChargePoint control and undetectable on their end."

"Mannnnnnnn, I just left a review on Tesla official app notification that I loved this charger stop and it was “smooth sailing”…. Until I just looked down and realized they changed the prices here today to tht wack peak pricing I see at other chargers.. it just went from .20 cents / kW, to now .37 cents / kW !! That’s almost double!!! And from 10pm - 10am they do .26 cents al/ kW now. Just wack they raised the prices here! idk why I would think they would keep the price low when all other chargers do this peak pricing stuff, but I thought we had our little home gem. 2 thumbs down for this!!!"

Just wack they raised the prices here! idk why I would think they would keep the price low when all other chargers do this peak pricing stuff, but I thought we had our little home gem. 2 thumbs down for this!!!"

Not crowded. Conveniently located in Meijer parking lot so great for a quick Shopping trip while car gets charged

"More banks than I expected- for the area seemed like a pretty large Supercharger site. They are all a longer than necessary walk to the store, probably because all the truck nuts will get angry and park in them. I'll walk, but I wish it didn't have to be like this because people are small sometimes."

"Tried 2 chargers when 17deg F, and both were frozen. Got nervous because I was at 5% with no other charging option available on Christmas day. Fortunately the 3rd charger worked. Images are of the chargers and plugs that didn't work. Not sure how to report this to Tesla."

These chargers are in great shape and conveniently located between a giant Meijer and Target so you can burn time. There are plenty of stations and often has a few open. Most of the other tesla drivers seem to be pretty cool. It becomes like a car meet

Great location. This was close to I-75 highway. There is a Meijer grocery store and Target w/ a Starbucks close by. There is also an Olive Garden that is a few minutes walk down the parking lot.

"There are several charging stations located on this lot. I haven't used any of them but it seems to get a good amount of ""traffic"" with cars getting charged up. They seem to be well maintained and some day who knows, maybe I will make use of them myself."

Easy to find and access...assuming others don't park in the no parking area in front of the charge point. The app didn't work for me and does take a long time to charge.

Edited 4.12.2023: the machines are now going to 60KW almost immediately. I'm happy they have been corrected. Still stupid expensive.

First review: This is the slowest level 3 I've ever been to and they charge by time. #DTE do better. This seems like a scam and they take advantage of no other nearby charges.

"Right near a Dunkin’ Donuts and liquor store. The charger itself is quite expensive, though."
Couldn't get the station to work. Ended up using the free chargers (2kw) nearby. Then drove down the street to the charge point station (5kw) by JR Automation.

"The chargers generally work fine. I have had issue now a few times with the chargepoint saying my card was not supported. But after trying it multiple times, it worked. Both my cards did this, so I tend to believe it is the charger at issue."

Awesome charging station! 100% free! Fast! There are some resturants and stores near by so you can shop or eat while charging. I was in Saginaw to check out the Mid-Michigan Children's Museum which I would also recommend. It's not in walking distance but its nice reason to visit.

"When I first found this station and it was free I intentionally visited Saginaw regularly to use it. Now that it isn't free anymore I haven't been back through Saginaw. Sorry local small businesses, it was a good idea while it lasted, but the city wants the money for themselves more than they want to attract business for you."

Someone sabotaged these superchargers
This is a very good Charging Station. There are only 2 or 3 Fast Chargers but so far it hasn't been a problem here in Yuba City.
I generally get the fast charge to 80% in about 15 minutes and pick up the remaining 20% to 100 in about an additional 15 minutes.
The only downside is the prevalence of homeless or at least very sketchy guys hanging out nearby in the bushes.
